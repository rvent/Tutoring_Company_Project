And last week she got accepted at Saint Louis and today to Eastern Virginia. We have selected Eastern Virginia out of the two. We are still waiting to hear from Wake Forest and South Florida.

With his help, I was able to score 97th percentile on my MCAT by only taking his course and with three weeks of intensive study on my own. I was absolutely shocked (pleasantly so) by how well I did. I don't think I could have achieved such a high score on my own. Noble helped motivate me and keep me on track. He was my cheerleader, encouraging me when I really needed it and was doubting myself. This process can be quite soul-crushing, and if you're a perfectionist like me, you will find yourself questioning yourself at different points throughout the process. I chose MCAT King because I know I would be getting personalized attention, not to mention it costs about half of what a Kaplan course would cost, and the instruction is MUCH better. I have been recommending Noble to everyone I know.\",\n",

       "    \"1 check-in During the Spring 2015 semester, I took MCAT with the help of Prof. Zaghi (Noble) for applying to med school as a second-career student. coming from a strong humanities background, I was in need of, not only a refresher course, but a teaching of basic concepts from the ground up to bring me to speed in my postbac class within a very short period of time. During our first session, Noble gauged quickly and accurately my understanding level and created an overall study strategy that combined learning basic MCAT topics while keeping up with my class's much more advanced material at the time i was taking organic chem. During our sessions, Noble exhibited a thorough knowledge of all of the material, using tons of easily understood examples and analogies to illustrate the more abstract and difficult concepts and many of them are super funny. I appreciated Noble's effective use of resources during our sessions, including use of a dry erase board and various digital resources.  Noble was also extremely reliable - always on time and readily accessible. We were able to Skype several sessions as well as meeting in person, which was very convenient for my schedule. I went from failing my first exam (pre-tutoring) to receiving an A in the organic chem class while studying for MCAT. I literally would not have passed my postbac classes without Nobles tutelage, much less received an A. I was ultimately accepted into 6 Med schools. He was a great help in the whole application process and the interview prep.  Dr. Zaghi is the epitome of an educator - someone with an extensive depth and breadth of knowledge who is able to understand where you're coming from and teach the material in a way you will grasp it. His dedication to helping each of his clients is readily apparent - he understands how important this is to you, and is genuinely committed to your success. I would strongly recommend his services to anyone!\",\n",
       "    \"Such an amazing tutor!!! Noble is the real deal- he's amazingly smart and hilarious, keeping you engaged even when teaching a subject like organic chemistry. He pushes you to reach your academic goals in the sciences by challenging you with problems and helping you remember concepts with his funny quips. Best tutor I've ever had in the sciences!\",\n",
       "    \"1 check-in I took the MCAT last year and did not do well.  I just simply wasn't ready and it was because of the way I studied for it.  This time around, I went to MCAT King for help and Zaghi changed my study routine and habits to make them way more efficient.  Through tutoring sessions, we covered a lot of material in ways that the review books just can't teach you.  He gave tips and tricks for solving physics and chem problems quickly and without a calculator and also just made the material easy to understand.  I still have a few more months before my exam and I can already say I feel way more confident this time around thanks to MCAT King and Farnad Zaghi.\",\n",
       "    'First to Review When struggling with Organic Chemistry Prof. Zaghi went above and beyond to make sure that I did well. He knew when all my tests and quizzes were and went out of his way to meet as much as I needed. He was very active and communicative. He really was exactly what you would want from a tutor because he really does care about how you do and even kept in contact in the future to help me with graduate school applications. He was an invaluable resource.'],\n",

I was worried that in a classroom course the other students would slow me down on the Math side and that in such a course I might not reach the performance I am capable of. Likewise on the verbal side, I was scared that I would slow others down. This was not the case at all. Behind the course stands a superb instructor, George, who is deeply dedicated to the student's success. George was fun, challenging and motivating! He taught the class in a friendly, easy to grasp manner and showed us invaluable tricks that are not found in the textbooks!!! It was clearly understandable, effective, and most definitely a painless way to prepare and succeed in the test.  I ascribe at least 100 points of my final 680 score to the course, George and the staff at MEP who gave me the chance to take a shot at achieving one of my dreams! I highly recommend Manhattan Elite Prep and the GMAT course with George!\",\n",
       "    \"I paid for Manhattan Testprep's TOEFL program back in May 2018. The program was advertised as a package of TOEFL test preparation classes taught by (i) experienced instructors with intimate TOEFL knowledge (ii) in a group setting meant to maximize the student's learning experience. Upon payment, Manhattan Testprep's sent an off the shelf questionnaire designed to place me in an upcoming session, at which point I clearly mentioned my anticipated test date in two months of July 2018. Manhattan Testprep failed to place me in a session that matched the requirements per the questionnaire as they did not have group sessions available. In fact, Manhattan Testprep forced me to compromise for a completely different private tutoring package that failed to provide the unique benefits advertised with group preparation. Without any alternative options provided by Manhattan Testprep, I was asked to attend the private tutoring sessions (ii) not in a group setting but (i) taught by an experienced TOEFL instructor. After two introductory sessions with the assigned instructor, I learnt this instructor had absolutely no experience teaching the TOEFL. This clearly contradicts the terms and condition of Manhattan Testprep's TOEFL preparation program offering. With the upcoming July 2018 test date and Manhattan Testprep failure to honor the terms and conditions, I was forced to promptly cancel the program and seek a full refund. The refund was requested on June 8 2018.  Manhattan Testprep argued against any refund as per their refund policy, which was only shared as reference after I filed the dispute. Furthermore, with regards to any policy reference, it's only valid if and only if the merchant renders its promised product or service. In this particular case, Manhattan Testprep falsely advertised a program offering and failed to deliver the promised service. This kind of behavior is deceptive and unlawful.\",\n",

I did very well on my essays and my qualitative portions.  I did well enough on the quantitative, considering how long it'd been since I'd done more than calculated a tip on a dinner bill.

       "    \"I had a positive experience with MEP classes in Washington, DC. There are multiple options for courses on different days and times and for different lengths of times (rush courses, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, etc.). The course experience depends on your instructor- I had a wonderful instructor named Laurel who was incredibly helpful. Students are allowed to sit in on courses for (I think?) 60 days after their original course's end date, but usually the instructor changes. I tried sitting in on some classes after my original session ended but decided not to because the instructor was not good. My least favorite thing about MEP is that enrollment in a set session (6 weeks, 8 weeks, etc.) is rolling and not limited to the beginning of the session. I found it frustrating to develop a rapport and comfort with my group and then have new students join who are not at the same level of preparation. The group size (even with the new additions) never got larger than 6. The courses are affordable if you keep an eye out for Groupons- I paid $500 for an 8-week course.\",\n",

I worked with their tutor George for 5 sessions where he targeted my weaknesses and helped improve my overall math knowledge, as well as my ability to see test patterns and concepts that I will need for the GRE.  I am much more confident than I was a month ago before I started and I can recommend Manhattan Review's private tutoring sessions.\",\n",

They are very prompt with answering emails and have gone above and beyond to help me prepare for this test. Not to mention, the online course is great! The classes are small and I have received plenty of individual attention from the professor. I have learned so much about what to pay close attention to in each question and answer type, plus they have provided me with an unbelievable amount of practice material and guidance for the exam. I couldn't feel better prepared. Thank you so much for everything Manhattan Elite Prep!\"],\n",

I thought that this was a smart decision in where it would help him understand what admission officers were looking for and help bring out the passion in his writing. I finally read what he complied in this session, it was a huge disappointment. The essay lacked passion and direction. A tutor is suppose to engage with the student to bring out his/her best writing skills but by the results of this essay this was not the case. Not sure who taught the session but I felt that they took our money and sent us on our way. When I asked my son about the tutors,  his reply was that they were nice. I dont want to hear that they were nice, I wanted him to leave the course saying that he learned a lot and felt confident in what he learned. Our eighth grader could have wrote something of better value without using their services.',\n",

We read some reviews and decided he would be able to help us with our daughter\\'s college admissions. He came highly recommend from a good friend, reviews were great for Cates tutoring. We bought a 10 hour package at $450 an hour (gulp!). We met with Chris twice, he was methodical and gave us good advice. The first two hours we met, we talked about what our daughter wanted to do, what her interests were and we also scoped out a huge number of schools that were a good fit and some that were not that great, not realistic with her given GPA. My daughter started the Essay writing and that\\'s where we stalled. It took appox. 7 hours according to them for the ONE Essay, back and forth between Chris and my daughter. They edited the essay written by our daughter and a draft was given to her parents(us) to read and approve. Final Essay was still to be written. This was a final draft. After all that \"work\"  the written piece was similar to 8th grade writing. Unimpressive. Not college level writing at all. No decent school would accept a senior with that kind of writing. We talked to Chris and we agreed to tweak it.  In the meantime we talked to his staff, who by the way were absolutely clueless about the hours spent. They said we had 4 hours left. Then they went against what they said and insisted we ran through the hours doing just the ONE essay. We had no hours left. Vague and unclear. And completely unprofessional. We were asked to buy another package for another 10 hours. My daughter decided to do the college applications herself and wrote out a completely new Essay. So the hours spent with Chris were a waste. We didn\\'t use the Essay they worked on together, she wrote a new Essay. This was all done during crunch time... when deadlines were upon her. We ended up not buying another package and we wasted $4500 and the 10 hour session we already purchased. We had to make this decision midway during the application process and were really left high and dry with no idea as to what we needed to do next. I wouldn\\'t recommend Cates Tutoring for college counseling. The writing was mediocre and the counseling was sub par. Value for money was zero. We have gone back to our friend who recommended them to us and she pulled back two additional recommendations she had made to common friends for Cates Tutoring.

       "   'User_Rev': [\"Stuart Park of Simply Brilliant truly helped me through the entire b-school application process and is definitely someone I'd recommend working with.  Overall: Stuart Park and Simply Brilliant helped me get through the entire application process. From GMAT prep, to essay reviews, to interview prep, to connecting me with other students - Stuart was a great partner to help me through an incredibly challenging process. Stuart helped set my mind at ease at a very stressful time for me. Stuart's essay/application assistance in particular was tremendously useful considering how labor intensive this area was for me. I highly recommend Simply Brilliant and Stuart Park for application assistance of any kind, as well as GMAT assistance and interview practice.  My Background: I live in Denver, CO and came from a non-quantitative background with 5.5+ years of professional experience. I was focused on getting into a Top 20 program. I took a Manhattan GMAT course and was initially scoring in the high 500's. However I needed some more help improving my speed and math score. Additionally, I knew I could use an extra set of eyes on my applications and wanted to find someone with experience with business school applications.  My Prior Frustrations before working with Stuart Park: Before I found Simply Brilliant, I had worked with another professional tutor in math, however was unimpressed with that person's pushiness and general lack of caring. This other tutor never seemed to move at my own pace. He was always eager to setup additional sessions but always seemed to care more about the business (and the money) than the client. Additionally, this previous tutor didn't make an effort to acknowledge or appreciate the previous study tips I had received through Manhattan GMAT, instead insisting that his tactics were far superior. This way of belittling what I had already learned did not help with my progression or general morale.  GMAT Experience with Stuart Park: I began working with Stuart Park about 8 months before I took my final GMAT exam. We first focused on question types of the GMAT that I was struggling with. Stuart did a great job of diving deep into specific question types. I liked how he had a lot of the material and books that I already possessed, which made it easy for him to focus on a particular question I was struggling with. He also offered some really helpful suggestions about study technique and test taking strategy (timing, preparation, day of test mindset, etc.) that helped me mentally prepare for such a big test. [i]In the end, I ended up getting a 670 on the GMAT. Because of how great Stuart was to work with on the GMAT, it was an easy choice to continue working with him for essay feedback and application advise.  Essay/Application Experience with Stuart Park: Stuart was especially helpful with reviewing my essays and giving me feedback on them. His flexible schedule and quick turnaround times with feedback were tremendous. I found myself applying to several schools each with a tight deadline. Additionally, I had a full-time job working 45+ hours/week. Stuart recognized this and cleared his plate to work with me at the times I was available. Stuart also took time up-front to understand what I wanted feedback on. I was very particular about the areas I wanted feedback. I wanted to make sure my voice was being represented in my essays. Stuart honored this and did not waste time in areas I was confident in. He also took time to explain his suggestions, which helped me understand where he was coming from.  Other Areas of Assistance: Stuart really went above and beyond to help me get into the schools I was interested in. We had several training sessions on interview preparation. Additionally, Stuart connected me with several students at a variety of schools I was applying to. This came in really handy when trying to research the programs and get to know current students.  Result: I was accepted to Kenan-Flagler Business School (UNC Chapel Hill) and Carroll School of Management (Boston College). BC offered me a $15k/year scholarship. In the end, I decided to attend Kenan-Flagler because the academic offerings aligned more with my interests and because it was a higher ranked program.  Things I really liked about Stuart Park: - Essay writing suggestions - Ability to adapt to my learning style - Ability to give feedback based on what I was looking for - Flexible schedule - Competitive rates - Ability to answer one-off questions - Eagerness to learn my story and background - Didn't nickel and dime me - Genuinely cared about my success!  If you're looking for someone to assist with any part of the business school application process, I highly recommend Simply Brilliant and Stuart Park. You can learn more at simplybrilliantprep.com.  Regards, Charles T.\",\n",
       "    \"I can't recommend Simply Brilliant more highly. If you feel like you have plateaued with your GMAT prep and need an extra boost, Stuart should be your first call.  After getting waitlisted at a top B-School, I was called in by their AdCom committee and asked to retake the GMAT. At this point, I had already taken the test twice, scoring a 660 on my most recent attempt. To prepare for my first two tries, I had completed a Manhattan GMAT course and utilized the Economist's online platform to study but felt that I was unfocused and unsure how to take my prep to the next level. After a terrible experience with and far too much wasted time on another tutoring company, a friend recommended Simply Brilliant to me. I went to Stuart at the 11th hour (less than one month to prep for the test that could potentially get me into my dream business school) and it proved to be the best thing I could have done.  When I first reached out to Stuart, I was stressed, frazzled and, to be honest, completely freaking out. His positivity and encouragement helped to calm me down and refocus on what was important - studying! Despite my demanding work schedule (60+ hours/week), Stuart worked with my availability and made himself available whenever I needed to squeeze in a session. He taught me countless new strategies to implement on test day and really helped me work through my issues with timing (particularly for quant). For both quant and verbal, he was able to take me through mini-lessons on all the key material and then did targeted study based off my areas of weakness. Keep in mind, he was able to cover all of this with me in less than a month without making any topic feel rushed or glossed over. I quickly started seeing higher scores on my practice exams, which helped me to gain a bit of my confidence back before the test day arrived.  In the end, I was able to raise my GMAT score 50 points to a 710. I am absolutely positive that this increase was a direct result of Stuart's help - there's no way I would have raised my score that much without it.  Right after the test, I shared my score with Stuart via email, and he took the time to call and congratulate me right away. You can tell he truly cares about his customers and genuinely wants them to do well. Not only is he incredibly smart, but he's also lovely to work with.\",\n",
       "    \"Stuart helped me get into the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.  My 1st GMAT score was fairly modest.  The last time I took an exam like GMAT was almost 20 years ago and I just wasn't prepared.  Beyond the knowledge of the material - which I could have learned through books, etc. - I was lacking the overall strategy and mental conditioning necessary to do well on the test.  I was also facing a very tight deadline for application, so I had to get going fast.  I started working with Stuart twice a week and saw an immediate improvement in practice tests.   Stuart helped me with both skills training and test strategies.  My GMAT score improved by more than 100 points in about 6 weeks or practice.  I would highly recommend Stuart to anyone looking for help no GMAT.\",\n",
       "    \"First to Review I started working with Stuart Park after what had already been a long journey five months prior (starting at a 420), beginning with him at around a 600. I knew I had the potential to score well into the 700's and knew that my issues had more to do with test-taking strategies, in addition to working at my verbal, which until then I had not addressed at all. Stuart was the most flexible teacher whom I encountered in my six months of test-prep work and he catered his lessons to suit my needs. He did not simply give verbatim structured lesson plans. He was very professional, adept in both quant and verbal (though we only worked on verbal together), and he saw my potential and helped me focus and break past the barriers holding me back. Stuart is a great tutor and coach and my work with him ultimately helped me score a 700 on test day, around a month after I had started working with him. I recommend him with five stars.\"],\n",
