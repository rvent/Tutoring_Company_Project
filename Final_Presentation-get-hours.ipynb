       "[\"I had an absolutely amazing experience in Victoria Crutchfield's GRE class, and I'm certain my fellow classmates did as well. I just finished my last class with Victoria and feel confident in my ability attack the GRE. More than that, I went from dreading math to truly enjoying it thanks to her enthusiasm and tutelage.  Victoria has every quality of a truly great teacher you can possibly imagine and then some - she really cares about where you're at and how to get you to where you want to be in terms of the material, strategies, and score. I started the class a decade removed from GRE level math and now fully fully confident in my ability to learn any concept and apply the strategies we learned in class to the test. She is incredibly mindful of the class's level of comfort with the material as a whole and always checks in to make sure everyone is understanding explanations, concepts, and strategies.  Highly recommended for anyone at any level. Of comfort with the material.\",\n",
       " 'Elaine Loh at Manhattan Prep was a terrific teacher and coach. She make learning fun and used 1:1 moments to tailor and maximize material to my learning style and objectives. With her support, I achieved a strong score and was accepted into both M7 business schools that I applied to. Thank you, Eliane and Manhattan Prep.',\n",
       " 'The Manhattan Prep course was extremely useful in getting me prepared for the Executive Assessment.  I highly recommend the course and specifically my instructor, Elaine Loh.  Elaine was energetic, super knowledgeable, and made preparing extremely efficient.  I achieved my target score thanks to Elaine and the Manhattan Prep materials.',\n",
       " \"I took both the in-person course and the Advanced Live Online course. The in-person course was a great primer to the GMAT and really useful. (I hadn't done much self-study on my own before). The instructor was awesome and I thought the course covered a lot of important information, but I wasn't thrilled with my quant score on the official exam. I used the retake option to enroll in the Advanced Live Online course at a discounted rate.  I was thrilled with the Advanced Course -- I had expected the online course to be harder to interact with, but it was a small group and really engaging. The Advanced Quant textbook itself was really great too. My quant score went up from a 42 to a 47 in just 6 weeks.  If I could do it again, I'd probably self-study more from the beginning and then enroll only in the Advanced Course, but regardless I'm really happy with my score and grateful that Manhattan Prep had the options that worked for me.\",\n",
       " \"2 check-ins If I could give more stars, I would. Prior to signing up for this course, I had been self-studying the GRE for about two months while juggling a full-time job that often put me into overtime. When I didn't get the score I was aiming for, I became very discouraged. I initially signed up for just the free trial session, but the positive atmosphere was what eventually spurred my decision to invest my time and money into the full course.  The full GRE prep course is 8 weeks long, and you learn helpful strategies as early as week 1. Jerry is an awesome instructor who really cares about your progress in the class and is really uplifting and encouraging. Sometimes all you need is the optimism and confidence to do well on the exam, and that honestly played a crucial role in my progress. There is also an emphasis on learning multiple ways to approach a problem, so the course can really help different types of learners.  Please note that you really have to consistently study to make progress on the exam. No course is going to magically transform your score if you don't put in the work. But my favorite thing about Manhattan Prep was that the practice exam results tell you what topic areas you need to work on and how long you spent on each problem, which is useful for identifying your weaknesses. For people like me, it helped me prioritize certain topics and hone in on where my shortcomings were. In addition, Jerry likes to check in with his students to see how they're doing without being too invasive. This helps apply just enough pressure to keep you on task with your study plan.\",\n",
       " \"On my first GMAT practice test, I scored a 600 and was filling a bit blue. I'd heard great things about Manhattan Prep and Rey Fernandez in particular, so I decided to pay the hefty price tag and give it a go.  I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that I didn't dread coming to class each week. Rey made it quite fun and there were a lot of really useful tips and tricks. I would 100% recommend Rey's class to anyone looking to enroll.  I do think the course is quite pricey, and if you are a diligent self-studier you would likely be more than fine buying the books and working through them on your own. I did take one make-up test and wasn't nearly as impressed by the teacher, so read your reviews carefully. Finally, I do feel that they purposefully make the practice tests a lot harder than the actual test, so keep that in mind if you start getting discouraged!  My score on the actual GMAT ended up being a 710 (91st percentile).\",\n",
       " 'I used Manhattan GMAT and Reed Arnold for my GMAT prep.  The course was great and really prepared me.  But I still was having trouble breaking the 700 barrier, which I felt was necessary for me to get into the schools I was most interested in.    To get over this obstacle, I set up 4 2-hour sessions with Reed and it was worth every penny.  Reed was extremely attentive and immediately found small weaknesses in how I approached different problems.  Additionally, he taught me different techniques and changed how I reviewed my work.  He listened to specific issues and designed a program to fit my needs and strengthen my weaknesses.  He made himself very available and even moved around his personal schedule to accommodate me during test week.   I have already recommended Reed to colleagues and friends.',\n",
       " \"I really appreciate Dan Bernstein's help! He made my GMAT score improve significantly (by 200 points) in only two months. I don't think I was able to get into my dream school without his mentoring. He was really good at listening to my concerns and pointing out the issues and directions. More importantly, he was also great at encouraging me during the most difficult time. I was very lucky to have Dan as my GMAT tutor!\",\n",
       " \"I was really optimistic about Manhattan Prep when I dropped $1600 for a GMAT course - the reviews were amazing, first class seemed great. 3 months later, after attending my classes, diligently completing the homework, leveraging their resources and practice tests online, I was baffled to consistently have trouble improving my score by more than 30 points on practice exams and ultimately my actual test day. Very discouraging and at odds with everything I'm reading here and read when I made the decisions Maybe it's because the curriculum jumps around a bit illogically, or maybe the framework didn't quite work for me in helping me tactically stop making the same mistakes over and over again on specific problems.   I could have paid additional for private tutoring, but $1600 for a class and physical books is already extremely steep to ask of your students. I found my post course assessment to not really tell me anything new from what I learned already during the process of completing the homework and CAT exams, and it felt as if my post-course examiner was going through the motions vs. deeply and insightfully looking at my challenges. $1600 and several months of limited time later, wish I had signed up for their GRE course in the first place - maybe I would have had better success.\",\n",

In an effort to improve, I then paid for a two-hour tutoring session ($500) hoping to get a \"game plan\" in pace but the session was not particularly helpful. Tutor was slow to reply to my emails, offered no feedback on my practice test. I called to find out if there are any resources to help struggling students improve - there were none. I was told I had to pay to maintain access to the resources while I studied for the subsequent test. The first test I took I had to cancel as I saw no improvement in score.',\n",

       " \"I can't say enough good things about Manhattan Prep. Prior to prepping for the GMAT with them (specifically, I used their books and did an in-person class with Matthew), I had not done math since high school (almost 10 years). Needless to say, I had to shake off a LOT of rust and couldn't have done so without Manhattan Prep. Their materials are incredibly user-friendly and are helpful throughout the process (i.e., from when you need to be explained things as if you're in kindergarten to when you are tackling more advanced topics/problems). Also, the class is a must - it provided a solid framework/syllabus for approaching the vast topic areas and Matthew provided incredible tips/tricks for approaching the test. Clearly, their help worked - I'm off to b-school in the fall and my ultimate GMAT score was absolutely instrumental in getting me there.\",\n",
       " \"I took a 9-session, live online course with Stacey Koprince and Brian Birdwell at Manhattan Prep. They are FANTASTIC. Not only are they subject matter experts, but they are engaging and bring the material to life. Moreover, they made themselves available to answer my questions and always responded promptly, day or night.  While there are many GMAT instructors out there, one of the things that really differentiates Stacey and Brian is their ability to provide tailored guidance to people in all score ranges. When I started out my scores were in the mid-600s. By the end of my preparation, I was scoring in the high-700s. They were able to provide me with foundational tools and guidance that were vital to breaking the 700-barrier and test strategy that helped me reach the upper-700s. Without their guidance, I never would have reached these milestones.  The bottom line is Manhattan is a great test prep company and Stacey and Brian are two of the best. If you are serious about test prep (and you wouldn't be reading this if you weren't) I HIGHLY recommend using their services. If is one the best investments you can make.\",\n",
       " 'I took the online accelerated GMAT course with Chris G. I am very happy with the course materials, the online resources, and the instruction that I received. I was originally skeptical about taking this specific course due to the fact that it was administered online. Now that it is complete, I can say that the structure promotes participation and accountability. As far as the scoring goes, the setup makes it easy to understand key areas that you can improve on to maximize your score and the materials Manhattan Prep provides you with unlimited ways to tackle these areas. Like most everything else, you only get what you give.',\n",
       " \"I took the Manhattan Prep Live Online Course because I had read great reviews of the company and also saw that they offered a 25% student discount (I am currently a college student, so this was very appealing to me). Manhattan Prep doesn't hold any in-person classes near me, so I had to take the online course. I was a little nervous about it at first because I thought I would get distracted if I wasn't in a classroom. However, I think the online course was a great decision for me. The Manhattan Prep instructors are extremely helpful and make time during class to give you one-on-one attention. There were ~10 people in my class and 2 instructors. The class met for 3 hours every week. The instructors engaged everyone in the classroom by calling on students and making an effort to understand everyone's thought process. The instructors solved practice problems with us, thoroughly explained common mistakes or misunderstandings, and walked through ways to approach problems that I found extremely useful on the test. I felt comfortable asking questions in class and reaching out to the instructors outside of class as well. Manhattan Prep also offers several practice exams with full, worked-out solutions and performance analytics capabilities. In addition to the 9-week online class, the plethora of resources available to me during through Manhattan Prep (GMAT Official Guide, Manhattan Prep books, practice exams, etc.) were invaluable to my success on the exam! I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to maximize their score on the GMAT!\",\n",
       " \"Outstanding online course that was perfect for a busy lifestyle and greatly assisted me towards achieving my goal!  If you put in the work outlined within the syllabus & actively attend the courses, then you'll reap results.

Best of luck to you on your studies and my sincerest thanks to Manhattan Prep!\",\n",
       " \"Came here for the full 9-week GMAT course and my instructor was Mike Morgan. It was a really useful course. The materials and syllabus for the class are well-planned and kept me on track to take the exam about 1.5 months after finishing the course. I worked a 60+ hour/week job while studying, so the homework was a bit tough to keep up with, but I felt it was very valuable to do so. My instructor was also great. His strength was definitely Quant, which is what I most needed help on and it ended up being my strength on the actual exam. He also did a good job of sending up post-course materials whenever we needed and working with us individually during breaks in class if we had specific questions. Most of my coworkers recommended Manhattan Prep over other prep sites and I agree. I would recommend that you take this course if you want an in-person weekly class to keep you on schedule. In addition, if you don't struggle as much with the content but more with specific GMAT strategies, this course would also be a good option. It's not really a course to teach you math/verbal content, since usually the content itself is straightforward - I feel that this is where a lot of other prep companies fall  short, as they spend too much time on the content - but rather the tricks and strategies to help you do well on the exam. Each course also comes with a lot of guides, the OG, and a testing dry-erase pad. The online exams are also extremely helpful to supplement the 2 official GMAC practice exams. To me, the MPrep exams were much harder but also helped me perform better as a result.\",\n",
       " \"Manhattan Prep was great, and I've recommended it to several friends since completing the GMAT course. I enrolled in Jonathan Schneider's online class.

       " \"Manhattan Prep is the best out there for GMAT prep. I worked with Chris Peckover and it was worth every penny - he provides you with tips and tricks that you simply can't figure out on your own. Manhattan Prep instructors are incredibly intelligent, have the most comprehensive understanding of the test, and work with you to personalize your study plan. Chris helped me identify my weaknesses (that I didn't know were weaknesses myself) and improve them to reach my target score. For those who are working demanding jobs while also prepping for the GMAT, Manhattan Prep helps to make your studying as efficient and painless as possible.\",\n",
       " 'For GRE prep: Unsatisfied with the program. I paid $1400 for in class, online, and paper materials. In class: you are with about 20 individuals, teacher spent too much valuable time asking students about their approaches and their fumbling thoughts on the question. Im sorry but as a full time employee and attending these classes after work or on the weekend I would prefer the teacher to focus on more problem strategy, time management, additional relative questions instead of asking us (students) what we think. I dont care what other people are doing. Im relying on this instructor to give me the tools to improve my score. 2) online materials were good, practice sets and questions but to be hones you can get a TON of this for free or significantly cheaper online. Magoosh, kaplan, princeton rev all provide tests even GRE ETS online has practice tests for free. You can even use Youtube 3) paper materials: probably the worst part.You receive SO MANY books and while you may like this approach: keep in mind a lot of professionals are 4,5,10 years out of school. We want an easy methodology to track our day to day practice goals and materials. Manhattan preps GRE course is VERY disorganized with their weekly study goals. It mixes, jambles, and goes back/forth to what questions and books you should be doing. I am not kidding when I say Its a job just organizing what you should study. I can even print and show a picture for anyone who is interested. There are online websites you can use to enter a test date which organizes your daily goal, each section you are to complete, provides the question/answer and poof youre done.  I strongly strongly advise any person interested in an organized, easy to maneuver course for GRE to hire a tutor, gather cheaper paper and online materials and save yourself the inconvenience and cost of manhattan prep. I wish i could get back my money and my time: neither of which MP provides back.',\n",
       " \"Really impressive curriculum. Amazing how I was able to walk in with such a mountain of expectations about the GMAT, then walk out knowing the exact strategies I'd need to succeed.  Having the books alongside the classwork means that, even if I missed something during instruction, there was a bible next to me to pull info from. Plus, their online tools made the Official GMAT Guide far less intimidating. I sampled three instructors, including my Primary Teacher, Matt Brandon, and they all were approachable and energetic.  Now, if you're not wiling to put in the hours on homework each week, this class isn't worth it. They can't train you, they can only teach you how to train yourself.  Everyone I know who's attended a great b-school chose Manhattan Prep for their GMAT studying. I was glad to see find out their recommendation was correct.\",\n",

The syllabus worked very well with these books and the course and instruction was very instrumental in my GMAT prep',\n",
       " 'Two years ago, I took a Kaplan course and I did fairly well on the GMAT. I was pretty content, but I wanted to see if I could do any higher, so last summer, I took a class with MGMAT with Gregg Lachow. More on him in a minute. But long story short, with MGMAT, my score fell more than 100 points. I then took a break for a few months and then returned and studied all on my own using my Kaplan material, and my score on my third try was the highest of the three. Do with that what you will.  The actual class is $1600 for 9 weekly sessions. Pro tip - if you know someone who works there, they can give you 50% off. You get a lot of homework, which I did and reviewed each week religiously, so you must plan accordingly. Seriously, I have never worked harder before in my life. On the syllabus, there are \"easier\" questions and \"harder\" questions, and I recommend doing both sets each week, in addition to the regular questions. I also recommend beginning to study before you take the class. They provide hundreds of flashcards with questions on them; you won\\'t have time to do this while in class so go through them before class starts. You may find them helpful.  You are given 6 practice tests, and once you finish those, the website regurgitates the questions so you have access to 6 more tests, but with a lot of questions that you will have already seen. So once I began the second set of tests, I felt that my scores weren\\'t very precise; I was more so being tested on taking MGMAT\\'s tests than on the GMAT itself. Also, the syllabus doesn\\'t account for all of the 6 tests, so you may want to adjust it based on when you want to take your real test.  There are several flaws. First, I found several math typos in their books and online material (that I confirmed with teachers). Numbers left out, wrong calculations, etc. This is bad enough when you are dealing with math, but when I emailed them to let them know about this, they not only did not care, but also did not fix them. Second, they only reveal to you after you\\'ve done poorly that you could have had a post-class assessment. And only if you reach out to your teacher once you do poorly will you find out about the post-exam assessment. This should be known to students from the get-go. Third, in class you do 2-3 questions a topic, but this is not nearly enough. I thought class time could have been used much more efficiently to cover more types of questions. Fourth, they offer a room in which you could take your practice tests, but this room is adjacent to a classroom with a very thin wall in between. With earplugs, you can clearly hear the teacher next door, which is very disruptive. And don\\'t bother nicely asking the teacher to please lower her voice. Fifth, my PEA instructor, Chris Peckover, who I had a session with in mid December, created unrealistic expectations for me; he wanted me to take my GMAT again two weeks into January, even though I told him I was going away for a week in December - how this made any sense to him, I can\\'t tell ya. He fully chose to ignore that I was going to be going away and that it wasn\\'t going be enough time. Good thing I didn\\'t follow his plan and waited a few more weeks... Sixth and last, while Gregg is very nice and funny, he could be a much stronger teacher. Also, once he found out that English is my third language, he kept making implications that I had a lot of grammar to learn when, in fact, I knew my grammar better than the entire class...  I really wanted to give MGMAT a higher rating - this is my score and money, after all - but it just wasn\\'t the fine-tuned experience I was expecting.',\n",
       " 'In-person class with Gilad - well worth it. Gilad is a patient instructor with a great sense of humor - a must for how dry the GMAT material can be. Outside of the instruction, the syllabus is a step-by-step guide on how you should spend each week. If you\\'re looking for a spoon-fed approach to GMAT studying, this is your horse. The resources available to students are also extremely helpful, including the post-course and post-exam assessment (try to get Tony, his \"process\" sheets are gold).  My only hesitation on a five-star rating is the cost of the program and my experience with private tutoring. The weight list for in-person New York, especially in the summer, is around the block and my experience with the online tutoring wasn\\'t ideal. It\\'s a hefty price-tag for a two-hour introductory session and I expected to walk away with a customized game-plan. Instead, I walked away with a lot of analogies and strategies that contradicted my course instructor. In short, go for the class and do your research on private tutoring options!',\n",

I have previously taken the GMAT to get my master\\'s in accounting (MAcc), and am generally skeptical of test prep services, but Manhattan Prep blew me away.  Jonathan was a fantastic instructor.  He was very well prepared for each of the 9 weekly classes, and I actually looked forward to attending them.  Jonathan has a way of breaking each problem into logical components to show you why one answer is more correct than the others, and is great at explaining how to \"beat\" the GMAT by skipping questions, interleaving study topics, and utilizing other test strategies.  My GMAT score increased over 100 points from my MAcc one, in no small way due to Jonathan and the other great instructors at Manhattan Prep.',\n",
       " \"I did 8 tutoring hours with Dan Bernstein and it increased my score by 1xx points (I won't tell you exactly how many; I'm not that much of a braggart.) I'd been out of school more than 5 years and owned a million GMAT books but couldn't figure out how to tackle them with any semblance of organization. I had less than 6 weeks until my test and was in a state of utter panic because I couldn't do any math in a reasonable amount of time.  Basically, the man is a wizard. Well, maybe not a wizard, but just a really patient, approachable math teacher who's capable of helping anyone circumvent a pathological math freeze-up. He's also a pretty cool dude.  And of course, the Manhattan GMAT materials are the best out there. I wasted way too much time with a Kaplan book. Don't do that.\",\n",
       " \"It has been my experience that there are very few services from which one comes away feeling as though they probably underpaid, especially a service as expensive as this however, I must say that this is one of those rare service providers.  The instructors are as advertised: smart, knowledgeable, helpful, accessible, friendly, and (to the extent possible) fun.  The instructors are the core of the service and the company must know this because they must pay well, and otherwise treat their workers well, because they attract and retain such high caliber people who are also really into their jobs.  What I noticed about the instructors is that despite the fact that they are ridiculously good at the test they can teach the concepts to both advanced learners and people who are particularly clueless on a topic.  They have a lot of patience and want to you to ask them the tough questions.  They are also great at motivating you and understanding the stress that you're under as you study for this test.  One time I was in class and I felt that the I knew the subject matter pretty well and I was clearly not paying attention. The instructor found me at the break and persuaded me to pay attention in a very subtle way.    Beyond the strength of the instructors, the prep materials are a key asset of the experience.  They do a great job of breaking down the concepts from a content standpoint and building your base of knowledge while also tying that content knowledge directly to real GMAT practice problems.  There are a ton of practice questions as well, which is important.  There are also tons of extra services that people tend not to take advantage of such as the office hours.  What I found to be a real gem was that if after taking the class you take the real test and don't do as well as you would have liked, the company gives you a free phone session with one of their best instructors to help you get on track.  Furthermore, if you decide you want to retake the class they only charge you $300 which is essentially just the cost of the materials; that's a pretty good deal.  All in all, I was very satisfied with my experience.  I wish that Manhattan GMAT could apply its management techniques to other industries as well.  This is a very uniquely well run business.\",\n",
       " 'I took this in DC, but I can\\'t find anywhere else to rate it so deal with it.  First off, I JUST took the GRE. Like an hour ago. And I did not get close to the scores I was hoping for.

Now, I know you might think well hey maybe it was just nerves. No, no it wasn\\'t. This class was the biggest waste of money in my life. That\\'s what I\\'m really mad about. Not even the score, but that I made such an \"investment\", put the time in, and got a negative return.  I think the classes might be great if you are border line retared. If you have below a 140, yeah sign up. Just keep in mind that if you don\\'t have a 140 or below and you sign up for this class, you might be in a class with 140s and below. Meaning while you\\'re trying to figure out more difficult problems, they\\'re trying to understand how to cross multiply. I might sound like a dick.....well if I\\'m so smart why didn\\'t I do better? And I agree with you. My point is that for over a thousand dollars, you are better of taking a few practices tests through the ETS book, identiyfing your weaknesses, and spending the money on a private tutor.  This entire standardized testing and prep is a scam and I despise it. I hated in during the SAT. And I hate it now, 12 years later. In closing, it\\'s not worth it. I would have loved to have posted this on their site, but then only put up pre-approved positive reviews.

You can go through the books and focus on the area you wish to improve on. There is plenty of homework to prepare you for the next class. After memorizing 49 words per week and reading over 200 pages for homework, one can't help but stock up on red bulls to stay alert.  3) 6 practice exams & daily vocabulary emails from the Blog editor.\",\n",

I figured if I was going to have a shot at getting into a top tier school, I would need a lot of help.  I signed up for a 9-week, classroom-based course for David Mahler. He was a fantastic teacher. In class, he not only shows you how to do a problem, he explains why other methods are bad or less efficient. In addition to the his incredible lecture method, he helps prepare you for studying outside the classroom. Face it, the course is only 9-weeks - you are going to have quite a bit of prep to do, after the course ends. Having a instructor that will help you build a game plan to test day is invaluable.  One of the competitive advantages of Manhattan is their OG Archer software program. Basically, it is an online program where you answer problems from the GMAC books. The software categorizes all the problems by type and difficulty and it times you as you answer problem, so that after a while you build up a big enough data set to see your performance analytics. You can sort your results by type, time, etc. and the software even creates scatter plots of your performance. In the end, you have a tremendous tool to help you quickly identify the areas where you need to spend the most study time.  While I missed my target score by 10 points, I improved 160 points from beginning to end and was accepted into my #1 school. Now that I am accepted to a top tier program, I don't care that I missed my target. Thanks David, thanks Manhattan.\",\n",

       " \"I took a GMAT course with Ceilidh Erickson this past fall (Sept-Nov).  Initially I felt the course was pricey, but in retrospect, it was worth it. In terms of course material, you are given a very comprehensive review of all relevant concepts, divided into volumes for each subject that make focusing on a particular area easier; this much is to be expected given the price and reputation. What I found impressive in the layout of the materials was the way it was presented - even the tone that is used in the books. Core concepts and strategies are effectively drilled in a positive and encouraging way, and there is an emphasis on overall test taking technique that is extremely relevant to a test like the GMAT. Included is also a breadth of material outside the subject areas (GMAT roadmap, business school advice, outside 1-on-1 tutoring session, to name a few) that gives you a really good preview of what to expect in the application process.  Ceilidh's instruction and style was excellent. She is exceedingly positive and likable, and her techniques are effective at keeping the class engaged. This was no small feat considering I took a class from 6:30-9:30 on a weekday, a timeslot when, after a long day's work, it was quite difficult to get excited to study. Even in the group setting, where students are always going to be at different levels on different topics, I never felt like we didn't touch a particular topic enough or spent too much time on one (of course students in a class setting need to individually tailor their own study plans).  In the end, there's no miracle course, and I always believe in these types of programs, you get what you put in. I certainly buckled down and put in a lot of hours, and kept up with the assigned work (for the most part). Even so, I can say that I wouldn't have been able to achieve my score improvement without Ceilidh and the Manhattan prep course. I recommend both to anyone looking to dive into the GMAT or improve his/her score.\",\n",
       " \"I took an in-person course with Jonathan last year and - seriously - it is the best thing I could have done to prep for the GMAT. I heartily agree with the other reviewers in my opinion of Manhattan GMAT - they really focused on understanding the material and the test itself, in order to produce the best scores. I thought Jonathan was a fantastic teacher as well - he really took time to help his students and seemed to genuinely care and want success for us. He's whip-smart and knows the test inside and out, and he made each concept easy to understand.  The class itself is a lot of work - don't come in thinking someone's going to do the studying/planning for you. There's a substantial amount of homework each week (about 2-3 hours per night if you space it out) and honestly, don't bother taking the class if you're not prepared to buckle down. There were a few people in my class who came in un-prepared each week and I just didn't get it - it's just a waste of your money to do that.    I took the GMAT three weeks after my course ended, and in the interim I used Manhattan GMAT's resources to review and refresh (they have an iPhone app with digital flashcards which I found really helpful for studying on the go). All that said, I ended up with a 99th-percentile score.  The GMAT can seem like a huge obstacle in the beginning, and even with the help of a prep class it's a lot of work - but it is doable. Manhattan GMAT was a huge help throughout the process for me, and I'd highly recommend them.\",\n",
       " \"Ii think it's overrated or maybe it really depends on instructors. I see a lots of good reviews about couple of instructors. have to ratings: .5 stars for books and tools and 2-3 stars for the course. I took in-person course with Ceilidh Erickson last year. First of it she was bit nervous when she taught, maybe she was new instructor at that point, I'm sure she is definitely knowledgeable. Secondly, the class was boring, even though I was motivated, couldn't wait to leave sooner. If you never studied GMAT before, mgmat is not a good choice. I felt I needed to prepare a bit before I went to took the class.\",\n",

Their online tools are awesome-- they track everything and synthesize all the information for you. They also have test simulation rooms where you can take practice tests. The company is just phenomenal.  The only cons: the elevators in the building are so incredibly slow/broken so you need to arrive about 15 minutes early. Also, the first few classes were in a classroom that had some air conditioning issues that produced loud noises. Not the most conducive to learning.Eventually though, we were moved upstairs to the 12th floor where the AC worked and the classrooms were nice and clean.  I have recommended this company for every single one of my friends who are thinking about taking the GMAT.',\n",

To its credit, Manhattan GMAT is smart *and* strategic - it doesn't teach shortcuts but helps you home in on your strengths and weaknesses.  And then gives you plenty of additional resources to improve your weak areas.  I was getting pretty pathetic scores on my practice tests - and even on the first GMAT I took *right after* I finished Manhattan GMAT.  But my second GMAT, exactly a month later, was 700+.    Bottom line: put in the work during the course + work with Manhattan GMAT's resources on your weaknesses after the course is over = you should reach the score you want.\",\n",
       " \"1 check-in I signed up for this class in December after feeling a strong compulsion to prepare myself for business school applications. I have a strong college GPA and, solid work experience, however I am awful at standardized tests.  I realized shortly after starting the courses, that my memory of algebra and most of the math was very very slim. I found the online videos really helpful to do alongside the workbook, because I could do it at my own pace. I also found the instructor Jen to be patient and helpful as I moved at a slower pace. I also enjoyed her self deprecating humor. She breezes through the material with ease, that makes me feel like I ride the short bus to class, but then she jokes about being a nerd who spends her free time taking tests, so it takes away some of the sting.  I ultimately stopped taking the classes in the middle, because I realized I was spreading myself way to thin between work and some other things in my life. At this time I have decided to put any business school ambitions on hold, so I never actually took the GRE, however I know for sure from the prep, that there is NO WAY I could go into this test without having done a prep course. If I decided to entertain graduate school again I would certainly  take another course with Manhattan GRE or GMAT. Only reason it isn't 5 stars is because it's pricey and I couldn't get any refund since I stopped after three classes, however they make that perfectly clear when you sign up, so I take full responsibility. It wasn't like I was mislead.\",\n",

Witty, dry humored, intelligent, and most of all excited and animated in front of the class, Gregg delivered week after week.  The course is set up to keep you awake, engaged and learning.  Gregg delivered to all levels of the class, explained difficult concepts with ease and turned the abstract into simple and meaningful stories and analogies.  He is great on math, stellar on readying/verbal, and spot on with writing.  What I also really liked were Gregg's tips at the end of each class about how to get into business school.    GREGG AND MANHATTAN GMAT ARE BOSS.  IF YOU WANT TO CRUSH THE GMAT, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ANYWHERE ELSE.\",\n",

I'd tried out a few other services (Sylvan and Kaplan) but found the people at Manhattan to engaging, interesting, and (importantly) great teachers.  The price, as mentioned, is a little steep, but I guess you get what you pay for.  The class sizes were small, the facilities were fantastic, and our instructor Daniel Yudkin really took the time to get to know us and help us out.  I'd recommend them to friends (and the people of the internet) any day.\",\n",
       " \"I took the 9-week GMAT course about a year ago and it was surprisingly enjoyable. My teacher was Gregg Lachow, who was very smart, down-to-earth, flexible and just very well-rounded. I believe I wrote on my review to them that I wished that he had been one of my college professors!  Apart from the teacher, every interaction I had with MGMAT employees was professional and helpful, whether it was calling for more information or even emailing them. I liked my class so much that I organized a group class at my company and worked with Evyn Williams, who was fantastic.  The 9-week course included a TON of books, from the official GMAT guide to ones by Manhattan GMAT. It also included access to a variety of testing tools on the website. I used these quite frequently and felt that they were easy-to-use and helped me track my progress.  In all, the price is pretty steep but I luckily got my money back for helping to organize the corporate class. I still think it's worth it for the great customer service, amount of materials they give you, and the quality of the teaching.\",\n",
       " 'Short version: Manhattan Prep is pricey but worth the investment. MPrep offers various test prep options depending on your learning style, such as online tutorials ($), practice tests and books ($), in-person courses, ($$) and individual tutoring ($$$). The instructors are well-trained to teach you effective strategies for identifying various questions types within Data Sufficiency, Problem Solving, Sentence Correction, etc. and selecting / eliminating answer choices based (e.g. avoiding common GMAT traps).  I completed the in-person course at their Chelsea location in February 2016 with instructor Ceilidh Erickson. There are 9 classes in total, 3 hours each. This class is a commitment, as students are expected to follow along the syllabus and complete practice problems outside of class - they suggest 10 hours of studying / week, and I realistically dedicated about 5-6 / week.  My initial practice score was a 600 and after applying what I learned in class for two months, I took the official GMAT and scored a 740. This would not have been possible without Ceilidh\\'s approachable and effective teaching style - her energy is contagious and I actually felt motivated to learn tips and tricks for \"beating the GMAT\". The GMAT itself does not test math / verbal skills above a high school level, but the way questions are worded and set up are meant to trick and trap test takers. Ceilidh equips you with critical timing strategies and answer-eliminating tricks to help you get (or guess) the right question. She is engaging in class and you will find it\\'s hard to zone out (or you will get called out!). I highly recommend Ceilidh and signing up for a free trial class to see if the class is a fit.After each class, she also sends recap emails which are a great refresher before the exam. As her student, you will always feel supported throughout the course, and after - she genuinely cares about your success and want to celebrate when you reach your goal!  Warning: The test is designed so you miss approximately half of the questions. Accept that you will miss questions and that you will have to give your \"best guess\" and move on sometimes, so focus on time management and problem recognition.',\n",
       " \"I took the ManhattanPrep classes early in 2016 and highly recommend the course. The classes and material (books and online portal) were great and helped me study to take the GMAT and get a score over 700. The books and online material are very streamlined so you study in the most efficient manner and don't waste time learning or doing things that won't help. Our instructor, Christine, was a lot of fun. Make no mistake though, the study and homework workload is heavy. I'd say 10-20 hrs per week.\",\n",
       " \"I did both the accelerated 4-week course and private tutoring to get ready for my GMAT, and they both helped me in different ways. The full course really helped me dive into the material and see the range of what I was supposed to know, but I gave myself too short a timeline and was frankly not able to study as much as I needed to get that glimmering 700 I was hoping for. Before the course, I took one practice test and scored an alarming 540- after, I was consistently scoring 650 but still needed to work on my quant. I did private tutoring with Dan Patinkin and it was so great. Dan explained things in new ways and was really patient with me, a total non-quant person. We did tutoring for about 2 months, and when I finally retook the test, I scored a 710!! (V44, Q42). It was a great experience and I highly recommend anyone who is stronger in one area over the other to do the private tutoring as it is so personalized. Thank you Dan & Manhattan Prep, I'm going to the school of my dreams now!\",\n",
       " \"This is a great class for several reasons:  It's small - about eight people in my class, there's a ton of homework, and the teachers (and everyone else working there) are friendly and helpful. Manhattan's process breaks down the test not so that you can weasel your way through, but so that you are able to understand each section as best you can and study accordingly.  I would take this class if you, like me, have been out of school for a few years but your brain hasn't gone soft. They stress that the goal is 170+.  Within my first two weeks of class, my score improved by eight points. Fallacy of causation? Probably not. I'm confident that if I don't score in the 170s in February, Manhattan did all they could, and it's on me.  I didn't give five stars because the homework review books are rife with typographical errors (not just typos, but entire conclusions in explanations carelessly copied and pasted from the wrong question) that will confuse the less careful student; and because of the following:  I must mention this because it cracks me up/infuriates me. Whoever compiled the practice material is quite the Ayn Rand enthusiast. Problems of state control, 'restricted' 'markets,' individual profit vs. societal gain, etc. were inserted into practically every possible practice section; one reading comprehension section I finished just now cautioned against government donations to charity. To me, the weirdness of all this stands on its own without going into the utter moral bankruptcy of the beliefs involved.  It's ironic, since a group of thoughtful people are clearly behind Manhattan's overall process. I highly recommend Manhattan if you're in the market and don't want to be in a massive class. I've also heard first-hand accounts that some other companies don't even teach reading comprehension, which seems dumb to me. May as well have all your bases covered.\",\n",

Their practice tests are harder than the real think which definitively helps prepare you for the test, and Joe is really helpful and totally willing to work with you during class and class breaks on questions you don't understand (I was that annoying kid always asking questions), and the guidance he provided in class was amazing. You need to make sure to do all the homework (the 2 important parts each week, but the optional is just that optional, if you don't get all the homework done before classes you are really setting yourself back). Really happy I did this course, and really thankful Joe was my professor, totally worth the money for quality instruction and materials.\",\n",

There's no guesswork involved--it's easy to find your strengths and weaknesses (and then improve on them before test date). Also, there's numerous online resources (LSAT interactive, games etc.). I can literally retake the course online.  The office, run by young professionals, has a mellow atmosphere and is well-organized.  Students in other courses seem to be content to be there, so overall welcoming atmosphere... plus free coffee.  Well worth every penny.\",\n",

Take the class with Joe if you can. My GRE math score went up a decent amount after taking this class. I'm giving Manhattan Prep four stars because I thought the course could have been just a tad longer (perhaps 10-12 classes) instead of just the nine or so we had.

The strategy guides that came with the course provided comprehensive GMAT knowledge points.  The syllables helped me progress in a steady and solid pace.

       " \"When I signed up to take the GMAT I enrolled in a Kaplan online course and went through and did all the class sessions and homework. But by test day, I had only improved about 30-40 points. Needless to say, I did not feel nearly prepared enough to take the GMAT. So I pushed my test date back by 4 months and enrolled in a 9 week in-classroom MGMAT course.  The course was great. My teacher, Gregg, knew how to teach the GMAT in a way that helped us to actually understand the material, rather than just glossing over the fundamentals. The strategy guides were very instructive and really taught me how to do the problems rather than just tips and shortcuts. It was presented in an easy-to-understand manner and I felt like I was making real progress. The class sessions were also very helpful. They helped to cement what I was learning through my homework, and I learned additional strategies and time management techniques. I feel like the Kaplan course was good for the basics, but the MGMAT course really helped to solidify the concepts and take my problem solving abilities to the next level. The online resources were also pretty useful, especially the practice tests. They seem to be fairly representative of the actual test, and my practice test scores were very close to what I actually scored, which ended up being about 110+ points higher than where I was when I started studying.  I would definitely recommend this course for anyone looking to see a huge bump in their score. Even if you can't attend a live class, the full set of books is definitely a score improvement guarantee. I definitely think that MGMAT was a huge factor in me being able to get a 700+ score.\",\n",

Céilidh made the 3-hour-long class go quickly with her sense of humor and her enthusiasm for the wiles of the GMAT. Her instruction was clear, confident, and well-paced, and it was obvious that she is truly an expert in this test. She knew everyone's name and got to know each student's strengths and habits. Céilidh was generous with her time, making a point of being available before and after class and via email.

I took a class and if I had to do it over, I'd probably go with private tutoring.  Compared to the rest of my class, I needed more help on the quant and much less help on the verbal, and because half of each class was devoted to verbal, it sort of felt like wasted time; I wish I'd gone with tutoring (since it's not like the class was that much cheaper) to have had more one-on-one, tailored instruction  That being said, I followed the curriculum religiously and did all the extra worksheets and materials as I prepared.  I took the test 4 months after starting the class and my score went up 80 points from my diagnostic. i think all the materials they give you can be very overwhelming but if you're able to keep up with the syllabus, and really put in the time, you'll see the results.  I appreciate that if you're not happy with your score they let you retake the class basically for the price of the textbooks, and I liked that I was able to have a few one-on-one phone calls with my teacher to go over various practice tests.

       " \"Writing this review was a no-brainer. If you are serious about taking the GMAT, have the time to put in each week to do the work, and want to get a very very good score, Manhattan GMAT is the absolute BEST company to work with.  I took a class in summer 2010. It was a 2-month class and I elected to take the GMAT the week after the class ended. I busted my butt doing the work and scored a 750 on the test.  Manhattan GMAT is the best for several reasons. First, the Manhattan GMAT strategy guides will teach you absolutely everything you need to know for the test--not only how to solve problems, but the tricks and the secrets. You should know these guides backwards and forwards.  Students have access to 6 simulated exams and hundreds of problems on the question banks. I found the verbal problems to be fairly accurate in terms of what you'll find on the GMAT, but the math problems were much harder than anything I saw on the actual GMAT. My point is -- if you are scoring well on the simulated exams then you will score well on the actual GMAT (unless you are really nervous test day, for instance, and just go in blank). Take as many of the simulated exams as possible--one every 2 weeks, for example--to get a sense of where you are.  Also, the instructors are easy to approach and very accessible. You should treat this like school--the instructors work for you and want you to get as high a score as possible. This is obviously how they keep their job! So email them during the week, speak with them after class, do whatever you have to do.  But sign up for Manhattan GMAT. Their curriculum and course structure are the absolute best way to ensure a 700+ score on the GMAT.\",\n",

Only downside is that it was a little crowded, but Jonathan did a great job of remembering everyone's names and making sure everyone was on the same page. He explained problems through different methods, so even if you didn't understand the algebraic way of getting to the answer, he would help you understand it through a drawing or making up test numbers, etc. Before taking the class I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I was more than 5 years out of college and hadn't taken a math or writing class in years. My first practice test was atrocious, but I made sure to do the homework every week and asked questions during class. I waited to take the GMAT a month and a half after the class ended for extra study time, and my score increased dramatically--nearly 100 points, hitting right in my target range!\",\n",

On a positive note, it\\'s a young and hip school in a nice Chelsea space.  Cordial staff and management seems to always want to know how to better the school and your learning experience.  Free 30-minute phone tutoring is helpful. The potential for this school to be a top prep choice is definitely possible - just not there yet.',\n",
       " '3 check-ins Although the fee for GRE prep is steep, it\\'s 100% worth it.  The teachers are responsive, brilliant, and provide good teaching instructions and examples for how to \"beat\" the GRE.  There are about 15 students in every class, so the teacher can connect with each student on a personal level and really address the class\\'s every need.  Jen Dziura is my teacher, and she is absolutely fabulous.  Her wit and funny examples keep us engaged and eager to learn more.  Every class has the same structure:  first half vocab/reading comp and the second half math.  Each are incredible valuable and truly help you improve your overall GRE score.  Between my first and second practice test, I raised my score 8 points.  Now with further instruction, I\\'m excited to see the next improvement I make.  Throughout the class you broaden your vocabulary and learn tricks to cut corners and improve accuracy.  This class is taught at a fast pace, so it is imperative that you do the outside work, which sometimes can be a bit overwhelming.  However, we receive daily blog emails with vocabulary used in context which helps keep the new material fresh.  The website is also worth checking out because it provides daily GRE math problems in addition to a variety of other resources.  I would absolutely recommend taking the Manhattan GRE prep course.',\n",

Default on shipping is 'Next Day' which is a $32-$35 charge. Book being delivered was $26..that makes the default shipping charge WAY MORE than the original price of the book...I feel swindled.

       " \"If you are willing to put in the effort and want to get a great score on the GMAT, I highly recommend taking Manhattan GMAT's 9-week course. There are a lot of different companies offering a variety of online/self-study courses, but I feel that their in-class experience is still the best way to go.  I took this course last year with Dmitry Royter and took the GMAT one month after finishing the course. I took the GMAT twice. I self studied the first time using the MGMAT guides but didn't perform up to my expectations. Then I decided to take the 9-week course, and I scored a 730 on my 2nd shot and will be going to my top choice b-school this fall.  Dmitry was a great instructor and explained all the strategies in a very clear manner. He was always very prepared for class and offered candid advice on what students should prepare for. I also recommend taking the class because it helps you stick to your schedule and introduces many useful tricks that you wouldn't otherwise know about.  The MGMAT material is very solid. I found the practice tests to be slightly harder than the real thing, but it's always better to practice that way. You have access to lots of practice tests and questions, and I suggest you treat them like the real thing as that will really help you improve. MGMAT also provides a free 30 min private tutor every week and this was very helpful to answering specific questions I had in the books.  Getting a high score on the test is all about being able to work efficiently under time pressure and knowing what to study, so I cannot stress enough that you have to practice and practice and also focus on the right materials. I scored a 730 on my second shot and will be going to my top choice business school in the fall.\",\n",
       " \"This course is worth its weight in gold!  I took the 9-week course and I couldn't have been happier.  I took up my score from a 480 to a 710, so I would say it makes a difference.  If you put in the time to read the materials and do the assignments, this class will take you far.  All of the course materials are very helpful and focus on teaching you the material first and then giving you all the tricks and shortcuts.  My instructor, Grace, was awesome!  Extremely knowledgeable and always available for questions, either after class or by email.    I also signed up for a Princeton Review online course about a year ago and it was a total waste of money.  I work at a large asset management firm and this course was recommended by all my HBS MBA colleagues who also (obviously) killed the test.    The locations all seem to be conveniently located and there are also one-day workshops and private tutoring available (though I can't speak for the quality).\",\n",
       " \"I took the online course with Matt and Noah. It was fantastic, pushed my scores consistently into the mid-high 170s (my diagnostic was in the 150s). The Manhattan approach, particularly in reading comprehension and logical reasoning, brought structure to my haphazard approach. I am very satisfied with my official score and I credit Manhattan with giving me the tools to achieve it. If you can't afford a course, check out their reading comprehension and logical reasoning guides.  I also have friends who have taken their courses and who have had similar experiences.\",\n",

My teacher (Kate) was extremely smart, and very helpful when it came to deciding what to concentrate on, how to study and when to take the test. I mostly studied from the books, which were amazingly useful- very well written, teach you everything from the basics, and allowed me to go at my own pace and eventually get a 750 on the test. Highly recommended- if not the course (once a week, and kinda slow depending on other students in the class) then definitely, definitely the books.',\n",

I wanted to get into a top B-school and that means getting a high GMAT score. Manhattan GMAT claimed they are targeting the people who want to score high above the average score, and so I went with them. Boy am I happy I made that decision.  I could tell I'm dealing with pros from the first second. The well kept office space, the clean classrooms, the complimentary refreshments, the nice kit every student receives on the first day. And the price - not that different from the others. I had an AMAZING instructor (Carrie S.) who managed to make me want to come to classes and enjoy all the sessions. She's funny, bright, sharp, and motivating. Manhattan GMAT has a great website with tons of features, they have a simulation room that provided me with the 'real experience' feeling before the test date. The location is super convenient and they have sessions to match anyone's schedule. Every student gets a private tutoring session per week (online, you can have it at 10pm on a Friday night!) and if you miss a class you can retake it in a different day.  Thanks to Manhattan GMAT I am not traumatized at all from the GMAT and I broke the 700 barrier on the first test. Go for it.\",\n",
       " 'I initially discovered Manhattan GMAT my sophomore year as an undergrad at NYU Stern. At that point in time, it was too early to consider sitting for the GMATs, but grad school became a milestone that was approaching the horizon. Come senior year, I knew the time was right to start preparing for the exam, as I was still in \"study mode\" and did not yet work hours that might make attending a weekly review class impossible. My personal goal, along with myriads of other people who take the GMAT, was to get a 700 (and eventually, an acceptance letter to Stanford).  Manhattan GMAT is definitely the best of the prep classes out there, both in terms of the instructors (and their ability to teach test material in an understandable manner) and the tools that are given in order to study (all of the review books, the simulation dry-erase thingie, weekly office hours, simulated exams on the weekends). Personally, I needed a very challenging course because I knew my score would be close to the 90th percentile, just based on my past with standardized tests and academic performance. I used Kaplan and Princeton Review books, and honestly they were like the \"Dummies\" series of GMAT prep. Manhattan GMAT is pricey in comparison, but you do get what you pay for.  My instructor was a quirky guy, with an off-beat sense of humor (so class was interesting). I was slightly disappointed with the personal feedback he gave me at the end of the course; it was vague and not very targeted. I was the only college student amongst my classmates, so I did feel out-of-place. I was the \"know-it-all/smarty pants\" in the class and at times felt like the instructor had to do a lot of backtracking to get some of the other folks up to speed on the fundamentals. My personal philosophy is that people should brush up on the fundamentals on their OWN time, and class time should be more about test-taking strategy and approaching test questions. That was my one gripe, that sometimes we would get hung up on a nuance in sampling with replacement and miss the big picture. There IS homework, so it\\'s important to keep up and not fall behind. It was a huge time commitment on top of my regular coursework. To be honest, I\\'m not sure if I could stay on schedule now that I work.  The office hours I mentioned earlier: for the duration of the course, you can schedule 1-hour phone calls with a Manhattan GMAT tutor. These were very helpful, as were the simulation exams. Basically, you schedule an appointment online and go to the Manhattan GMAT center (usually on the weekend) where you are timed in a computer adaptive setting (it\\'s more realistic than bumming around in your PJs while watching Hangover Saturday or whatever on TBS and MAYBE practicing the Analysis of an Argument). Although the simulation is helpful, it does not compare to the actual test day (I had to take the GMAT twice because I was so psyched out the first time, more on that below).  As a Manhattan GMAT student, I was also offered discounts on the other courses available. I wanted to brush up on data sufficiency, so I took a Quest for 700 course (which is like a Webex/weminar, it only lasts a few hours). I definitely felt like this was helpful and the instructors used the media to the best of their abilities.  So, as I mentioned earlier, I \"bombed\" the GMAT the first time I took it, primarily due to nerves and not fully knowing what to expect (bombed = did not achieve my personal goal). Dude, I was so depressed that I couldn\\'t get out of bed for days and drowned my sorrows in Ben and Jerry\\'s. People thought I broke up with my then-boyfriend, that\\'s how pathetic I was. Anyway, I talked to one of the Manhattan GMAT reps about this (whilst breaking out into hysterics) and she told me that they would extend my online membership (which is where you have access to the practice exams) for another couple of months and that she would set me up with a GMAT counselor/GMAT life coach to help me for next time. Which comes my only qualm with the five star review I am giving: I never received a follow-up regarding the GMAT counselor appointment.  Guess what, I figured it out on my own. After graduation, I spent countless hours on the Eurorail over the next few weeks with my Manhattan GMAT books in tow. I returned from Monte Carlo tan and fabulous and ready to annihilate the GMATs. And I did! I still have my unofficial test score print-out on my fridge (I\\'m a nerd). Thanks Manhattan GMAT!  I\\'ll let you know when the acceptance letter to Stanford arrives.',\n",
       " 'I highly recommend using Manhattan Prep. Their way of explaining problems far surpassed that of Kaplan. There was enough theory and explanation to prepare readers for the application of new knowledge. I felt much more prepared after using Manhattan for my second take of the LSAT than when I took it the first time after a 3 month-long Kaplan course. 100% satisfied.',\n",
       " 'I was initially attracted to Manhattan LSAT (formerly known as Atlas) because of the quality of their instructors (99th percentile LSAT score plus at least 2 yrs of teaching experience).  The high-caliber of their instructors coupled with their top-notch curriculum, which is presented in a very intuitive and effective way, helped me learn the test from the inside out.  The result was that I felt very confident on test day.  Manhattan LSAT is refreshing because they are very straightforward in their approach to teaching the LSAT.  They do not offer any gimmicky shortcuts, but rather provide proven strategies for conquering the test that simply work if you are willing to put in the effort.  I took an in-person class, but the online component is also an excellent resource that I found to be very helpful.   My instructor (and everyone else from the company for that matter!) was extremely knowledgeable and professional but also friendly and approachable too.  I would wholeheartedly recommend Manhattan LSAT to anyone who is thinking of taking the LSAT.',\n",
       " 'In my opinion:  Most importantly, Manhattan GMAT has, by far, the best course materials available. During my prep course selection process I could only realistically compare the course curriculum between companies. I spent more than a few visits in Barnes and Noble to look at the Manhattan GMAT, Kaplan, and Princeton Review books.  Anyone who seeks to score well on the GMAT must acknowledge that the majority of the prep work will not be done in the classroom. Therefore, I thought it was crucial that the prep books had good knowledge to impart. As a tutor serving my University I easily recognized the vast amount of effort Manhattan GMAT has put forth in their prep books. I found myself thinking, this is exactly how I would break this problem down for my clients. As I knew that all programs would have highly qualified teachers, the study guide content carried much weight in my decision making process.  Moreover, Manhattan GMAT is unique in that the prep books INTEGRATE the official GMAC study guides. The \"study\" portions of the GMAC books seem like summaries of the Manhattan GMAT guides. At one point in ealy March, I remember looking at the Manhattan guides and telling my friend \"I think MANHATTAN GMAT IS THE REAL DEAL.\"  I finally decided to pursue the test with Manhattan GMAT. At first I was slightly dissappointed with my decision. The classroom interface was not as sleek as some of the other programs. The additional tools, such as the OG Tracker (you will find out soon enough), were also not as sleek as some of the other prep programs appear to be for tracking progress.  Although, after some time, I began to appreciate using the bulkier tools. The reason is two fold: 1. I knew every single data point I entered; watching my right/wrong and timing over/under for every single practice problem 2. The time spent entering information gave my brain brief breaks from problem sets and studying. The result was, that I was mentally fresher and well aquainted with my strengths and weaknesses.  Finally, the staff at Manhattan GMAT have been fantastic. The instructors were prompt in response to any questions outside of class. The customer service team was professional, reasonable, and helpful. Manhattan GMAT and its employees also never made any kind of silly promises. Promises like refunds for unimproved scores. (Please save yourself the time!) The GMAT will teach you the value of wasting even 2 minutes.  If your score doesn\\'t improve during a Manhattan GMAT course, it is not Manhattan\\'s fault. Manhattan GMAT marks the trail, gives you a compass, and a map; but you have to hike for youself to climb the mountain. They can help you climb higher and faster more safely, but the work still rests on the student to achieve the final score.  If you want to be the best you can be, commit yourself to working this program and you will not regret it.  On January 10, 2010 I took a free practice CAT with Manhattan GMAT, my score was a 580.  In early Feburary, I took a brief, non-adaptive, pre-test with Kaplan, my projected score was 630.  In April, May, and June I studied with Manhattan GMAT. In July I reviewed my course objectives and practiced problems daily.  On July 24, 2010 I felt my heart pound as I revealed my score at the Pearson testing center... 760 99th Percentile.  Thank you Manhattan GMAT. Business School, here I come.  -Brent Carpenetti Carpenetti Calculus',\n",
       " 'I completed the Manhattan GMAT December bootcamp back in \\'08. In my opinion choosing Manhattan GMAT materials or classes is the smartest choice a person can make on his or her GMAT preparation.  I originally heard about Manhattan GMAT from a friend, a b-school applicant, who was raving about MGMAT\\'s materials and classes. I did my research by browsing various b-school forums and speaking with friends and found MGMAT to be clearly superior to other \"top\" GMAT preparation services. Here are some key findings from my research and study experience:  1. Manhattan GMAT has instructors of the highest caliber. They are not only as smart as you can find anywhere, but they are also extremely supportive, approachable and excellent at teaching (not to mention great personalities). They will equip you with multiple ways of solving a problem and explain things until you totally \"get it.\"  2. With the exception of the score you get on GMATPrep exams (you can download from mba.com), the score you get on Manhattan GMAT practice exams correlates very strongly to your actual GMAT test. However, you need to keep in mind that Quantitative problems from Manhattan GMAT tend to involve many steps and are therefore more computationally intensively and time-consuming. I\\'ve heard MGMAT is working on addressing this problem but even so these harder problems will train you to be even better at the actual GMAT exam.  3. The study material from Manhattan GMAT is simply the best. The materials from other prep shops such as Kaplan don\\'t even compare (I\\'ve flipped through Kaplan\\'s in Barnes & Noble). All of the Manhattan GMAT study material are excellent but you must paid the most attention to their sentence correction and math guides. I adopted everyone of their techniques in these areas. MGMAT\\'s materials on critical reasoning and reading comprehension are also best in the industry. But in these two areas you need to practice a lot more and use their material as a basis to hone in on your own test taking strategies. For example, their recommendation of drawing a T-diagram was unnecessary (perhaps even damaging) for me personally on doing critical reasoning problems.  Additional pointers: 1. The Official guide problems and GMATPrep questions (try to find every single one of them on the web, not just those that are \"randomly selected\" for you for your practice exam) are THE most important study material first and foremost. OG come with the MGMAT package and GMATPrep you can download.  2. If you\\'re working, I think 9-week course is perfect as it provides you with the discipline. Studying for the GMAT is no joke, you\\'ll need discipline and stamina.  3. If you\\'re short of time, take the bootcamp. But I would caution you to allow for at least 2 possible test dates (you can take an exam every 30 days) AFTER you finish the bootcamp and BEFORE the application submission deadline. Even the best of us can mess up on the first try.  4. If you\\'re really disciplined, I think doing the self-study program from MGMAT would be best.  5. In my opinion, Manhattan GMAT will get you 80% there (no other prep shop would even come close), and the rest must come from doing actual old GMAT problems like crazy to discover and really get the feel for the patterns in the answers.  Manhattan GMAT might not make you smarter. But if your goal is in beating the GMAT (700+) and you\\'re not not afraid of hard work, you have the best chance when you choose Manhattan GMAT.  I know this review sounds like an advertisement but I\\'m taking the time to write it because I want to benefit others and  because I feel very grateful for their services (I got a 700+)',\n",
       " \"This is a great service. I went from a 590 on the practice GMAT to a 720 on the real gmat after a couple months of studying.

I've never had a problem with questions and they were always cheerful when replying to questions.  The location of Manhattan Gmat right in midtown Manhattan & ambiance were also great. It's a modern setup which was aesthetically pleasing.  The class makeup policies were also second to none. I've missed 3-4 classes and had no problems at all rescheduling.

       " \"Overall I had a very good experience with Manhattan GMAT.  The administrative team is helpful and knowledgeable and I was very pleased with the instructor who made the 3-hour class after a long day of work rather painless.    I started my course in September.  When I began, I had no major plans to take the exam quickly or by a certain date.  I took what the instructor said to heart about not waiting too long to take the GMAT and set the date for about 2 months after the class finished.  I just took my exam last week and am very pleased with my score.  Five months ago I was just starting to think about it and now I am finished - I couldn't be more relieved.    The course is expensive but it gave me a) ALL the materials I needed to study, b) the foundation I needed to really start the studying process, and c) the motivation I so desperately needed to do work outside of class.  I was very diligent with my homework so I had a strong foundation on which to build when I started working on official GMAT questions.    Not only did I get a great deal out of the classes themselves and the homework assignments, but there was always support if I had any questions on the answer explanations (indispensable) on the practice exams or questions about signing up to take the GMATeven after my class was finished.  It is obvious that the people at Manhattan GMAT care about their students and really want them to do well.  I recommend the school to anyone who is serious about doing well on the GMAT.\",\n",

The class I took had a bad teacher and so that experience was a complete waste for me. I would recommend sitting in on classes with a few different teachers before picking the one you want.  One of the most valuable parts for me was access to a free tutor for 30 minutes a week throughout the course of your studying. I had one tutor who I originally thought was great, but did not point out to me my shortcomings and as a result of my inconsistency, my first GMAT score was not very good. I then, by chance got Liz for a tutor and she was AMAZING. She single handedly explained to me what I was doing that was keeping my scores inconsistent and what I needed to do. As a result I increased my GMAT score by 50 points.  Thank you LIZ!!!!',\n",

Approximately two months after completing the course I took the GMAT and beat my target score (700).  The course provides a recommended schedule, which is a bit intense, but worth the effort.  The books/materials are well written and straightforward.  Additionally, the course is flexible in that it allows students to take makeup classes online or at the center.  All of the instructors I met seemed well informed and friendly.  The program is a bit more expensive than others, but worth the cost.',\n",

The best  thing about the program is the teachers, especially my teacher Andrew.  You know the teachers are smart and really know the material, no doubt a result of them having to score in the 99th percentile.  Andrew and the entire staff at MGMAT were very helpful and you could tell they were genuinely interested in helping you get the score you were trying to achieve.  I had taken the GMAT a year earlier and managed a 590 and was able to score a 730 after my MGMAT class. They not only teach you the necessary content, but also the strategies to conquer the GMAT. If you want a 700+ score this is the way to go.\",\n",
       " \"I did a lot of research before signing up for Manhattan GMAT.  Kaplan has offices right near my apartment so it was really tempting to pick them and lesson my commute when class ends at 9:30 pm, but the overall feedback I heard was that Kaplan is the fast food of test services.  They don't specialize in the GMAT like MGMAT does.  There instructors are young (i have a few friends who teach Kaplan) and yes they are smart, but not as professional as the quality of teachers MGMAT attracts.  The books for MGMAT are far superior to the others, i've gotten books from friends who've taken kaplan and princeton, and Manhattan GMAT is much more thorough.  The thing about Manhattan GMAT is that they focus on concepts not as much on tricks.  If you're someone who can't understand math at all, and works better with pure strategy, MGMAT might not be for you.  Instead of telling you want modifiers, and subjective form are about, they more expect you to know coming in.  I suggest if you've been out of school for more than 2 years you brush up on the foundations of math before you start your course.  My instructor was perky and smart, and you can tell they are the best around........they get paid more per hour than other instructors.  The location on 25th and 6th isn't the best or the most convenient but it is what it is.  The computer adaptive tests that they make available on their website is the most helpful.  When you start really look over everythign the website offers you, the forums are great, they have staff pretty much 24/7 to respond to your needs.  I'm also pretty sure if you search online for coupons you can get 15% off the price, which is helpful since it is more expensive than the others.\",\n",
       " \"I took the Manhattan GMAT course in New Haven after discovering that I really didn't have the materials or self-motivation to study properly for the GMAT. I didn't need any classes or tutoring for the SAT but the GMAT is a different beast. The class is useful as long as you keep up with the material and commit to doing the homework and making full use of the resources available to you, so if you have the discipline to do the self-study guides I would recommend that because the bulk of the learning comes from the strategy guides and really understanding the basics behind the questions before you do serious practice. The courses are generally really well taught though and the instructors really know their stuff, so if you do better with some structure go for the course. It is definitely a curriculum geared towards people who want higher scores (i.e. 700 range), so don't expect a lot of time to be spent on the basics. I found this a relief though because I was starting out in the high 600-s and wanted to hit the 99th percentile, which I did after one try. The MGMAT course definitely gives you the opportunity to make that much of an improvement if you're committed to it.\",\n",

His calm and reassuring teaching style helped me think clearly even in my most panicked moments. For me the logical reasoning section presented a particular problem, I found that I was so frantic about getting through it that my accuracy was extremely low. The strategies that 180 Degrees LSAT helped me master allowed me to see huge improvements in that area.  I always found Larkin highly professional, but also accessible.  Although I knew that the concepts we were working on might seem easy to him, he never made me feel slow or anxious. (Which is saying a lot). I really appreciated that he always gave me time to think through my answers, but offered support when he could see that it wasn't quite clicking. I don't think that I would have been able to improve as much if he didn't make me feel comfortable enough to push through my anxieties about the test. Until now I didn't realize how important it was for a teacher to be personable.  Before working with Larkin law school felt like a pipe dream, something that I had always wanted to do but was not realistic. With my new score I am so excited for the opportunities ahead of me. The process of applying in the past was something I completely dreaded, I am now excited to see what happens!\",\n",
       " \"First to Review I started taking classes not long after my first diag because I was scoring a lot lower than I wanted - fluctuating around 140 - and didn't really know how to improve it. I worked with power score for a few months and managed to go up a few points but it wasn't anything significant and I felt like they weren't actually helping me. Upon doing some research I realized that maybe it would be best to get a private tutor so that the advice would be more personalized.  Next I went to another popular tutor in NYC for a few weeks and didn't actually see a huge improvement between them and the power score classes. All of the advice I was getting seemed very generic and was basically just the same things that they would teach in the prep classes. I knew that I could take advice and suggestions and apply it, but that was not getting me to where I wanted to be.  After I left my first tutor I called Larkin and one other NYC based tutor. Larkin was able to give me a free consultation over the phone the same day that I emailed him and I was sold after that phone call. I explained to him my problems and why I felt like teachers weren't really getting through to me and he told me that it was a common problem. He said there would be no formulaic advice and he would help me work out my specific weaknesses instead of giving me something generic.  I met with Larkin for the next few months and my score jumped up nearly twenty points!. As it got closer to the test date I grew increasingly nervous about it but Larkin was able to help me parse out my anxieties about the test and make it go by a little smoother. I ended up with a 160 on the test (honestly higher than I had hoped to reach) and I feel as though I owe it all to Larkin.  I would definitely recommend Larkin to anyone looking for a private tutor.\",\n",

When I came to him I had essentially been told I wasn't smart enough for LG, Larkin helped me consistently get -0 in that category. I chose to use him because of other reviews on his NYC branch, and strongly encourage anyone looking for improvement to do the same. After scoring a 145 on my first diag a year and a half casually studying and a class and I was still not seeing the scores I needed.

The teachers and the staff at bright kids wen out of their way to accommodate us even with the last minute sessions and the scheduling changes.   We had a 10 session package we did but we added more after we saw my son struggling on the math portion of the test. The teachers suggested materials and books that I could work on at home with him.  I was also happy to see that the teachers who taught this test really need it very well.  They have been very organized and professional and the results obviously speak for themselves.  I have already sent a few of my friends tree and will continue using their services. While the services aren't cheap, it is comparable with other companies. At least they create their own materials so you feel like you are getting your money's worth. That coupled with their excellent service made this process so much smoother.  I also bought some if their books to support my son at home; I just wished they had a few more practice tests.\",\n",
       " 'Both of my kids go to G&T schools (one with no tutoring, the other *in spite of* tutoring from Bright Kids) so this is not sour grapes: They are simply not good at what they do. Each week the tutor du jour (they switch every week, which would be fine but read on) would call me to tell me my child\\'s weaknesses. I would say, \"Yes, we\\'re aware of his weaknesses, and last week I asked the tutor to have the next tutor focus on them.\" And they would reply: \"Oh, well I didn\\'t read the notes from last week\\'s tutor so I didn\\'t know that.\" This happened week after week after week until the test. At one point we spoke with the manager, and it was as if she was reading a script. She didn\\'t care and didn\\'t help. It\\'s a factory. Tutor if it makes you feel more comfortable, but don\\'t do it here.',\n",

Started off slow, but through each class they were able to make the experience fun and keep him engaged.  In the end he ended up scoring in the 97th percentile.  Hats off to each of the teachers who had a part in this.    We were realistic in terms of understanding that this test does not measure intelligence but rather prepares him to compete with other kids whose families have the resources do so.',\n",

Our daughter Ellen loved the staff and her instructors especially.   Both Arianna and Sara were able to customize the program to focus on Ellen's weaknesses and increase the level of difficulty of the material accordingly where she was strong.  This resulted in our daughter getting a 99 which is the best a parent can hope for.   Now we hope she has as much success in the lottery for city wide schools since there are over 900 students with 99 and only 200 available spots.  Unfortunately Bright Kids won't be able to help us with that one :)\",\n",

Our account manager is also very attentive and a great communicator. I highly recommend a trial for any child looking to strengthen their academic knowledge and strategies to problem solve.\",\n",

       " 'Must avoid Bright Kids at all cost.  I was hoping to get a professional tutor and effective results at Bright Kids. But it was sure a disappointment.  Especially, at the high rate of a mandatory $250 diagnostic test and $161 class per hour per session.  You can bet that you will get better results elsewhere.    My request for a tutor was to get a licensed education background with extensive experience working with elementary school kids, preferrably 5th grade experience.  Bright Kids  matched me with a teacher.  (I checked out School Digger ranked, 1576 out of 2263 elementary schools).  Even with low rankings, I continued with the tutor, because in my mind, you really don\\'t need an Einstein to teach a fifth grader.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt.    During the end of the lesson, it appears all the tutors will give the parent a summary about how the lesson went.  The tutor was proud to tell me that my child only had two wrong on all the worksheets done and that she was doing well.  I was not pleased at all.  You must be thinking, \"Why\"?    First of all,  my child is a superior and bright child who scored low 4\\'s on the state exams (ELA and Math).  The reason why we are here, is to work on her weaknesses to improve and achieve high 4\\'s for upcoming exams. Seriously, I do not need to pay $161 class/hour to reaffirm that my child only got two incorrect and that she is doing well.  Remember, Bright Kids charged me $250 on a diagnostic assessment, which the tutor confirmed he DID NOT even look at.  The issue is why do we even have to pay for a diagnostic test, whopping $250, if the materials taught was not focused on the weaknesses of the child.  It\\'s ridiculous!  I truly shouldn\\'t have to pay an arm and a leg to hear about my child\\'s strengths.  I do not believe the lessons are tailored to each child\\'s strengths and weaknesses.  Worse of all, during the first lesson, my daughter did not know the definition of the word, apparently so didn\\'t the tutor.  He accessed his data phone to look up the definition to teach my daughter.  What do you think of that?  Worse of all, my 10 year old commented that the tutor wasn\\'t even paying attention to her.  He was busy surfing on his mobile phone most of the time during the one hour session.  Many times, I have tried to email the account manager with concerns and questions and never received any responses.  Very unprofessional.    Next thing, I want to mention is that the Bright Kids is not willing to work with the parents and not accommodating whatsoever.  Bright Kids is supposed to be in a service industry to help parents and children.  However, I feel that they refer to their \"policy\" so much that they lose touch about why the Bright Kids business was opened in the first place.  In a nutshell, I feel that Bright Kids is money driven more than trying to help the children.  One thing they did do is issue a refund.   No headaches.',\n",

My daughter scored a 98, which was great, but just as important to us, she found the whole experience fun and low-stress. She loved her teachers and found her class time engaging and entertaining. On the test day she was recovering from a double ear infection so she wasn't in the best mood--but when we told her she'd just be playing games and talking like she did at Bright Kids she got a big smile on her face, and happily and confidently walked into the test room knowing just what to do.

They cover the entire spectrum of test prep, from the diagnostic through providing detailed feedback after each individual session.  Each tutor posts a detailed feedback report online after each coaching session, and the tutors work on each child's particular weaknesses.  I am happy to report that both of my children scored high enough to qualify for the citywide G&T programs.  I look forward to utilizing BK's tutoring and coaching services going forward.

However, the comment by Bright Kids NYC owner is either uninformed or deceptive: they absolutely used an iPad app (or program) with my son and that was almost the entirety of what they did. After each session, they showed me what they had done on the app.  Methinks this is an attempt to whitewash valid criticism. So, I'm lowering my rating from two star to one star.  Instead, I recommend that parents work with their kids on general puzzle books. You'll have fun and they will learn something.\",\n",

       " \"I can't even begin to express what a bad value I feel I've received from Bright Kids. Furthermore, the process has been painful. For about $170/session i signed my daughter up for 8 G&T tutoring sessions -- what they call their bootcamp and boy, do I feel like a sucker! 1) they don't even assess against the test itself. So if a kid needs to get a 99% to get in to a citywide program, you don't know how they benchmark against this score. They never give kids the test and just tell you how they did on sections like five correct out of 8. Well, were those 8 real test questions? is 5/8 62%? who knows???? 2) I think this is the priciest program out there. 8 weeks after starting, I have no idea how my kid benchmarks...a mock test is apparently a separate service!!!! 3) you have no way on knowing or gageing improvement, it is totally subjective based on the tutors assessment. Now, tutors are never the same from week to week, so again there is not consistent standard for measuring improvement 4) When I tried to reschedule a session more that 24 hours in advance because my daughter was sick they said they normally charge for this change; but after I raised hell they waived it 5) I have no idea what the quality of tutoring is since you don't actually go in to the room as a parent. I'm not sure how anyone can attest to the quality of the tutoring...how would they know?  There is one thing and one thing only that they do well. They have an online portal to access the tutors comments from week to week.  While I understand that every business needs to be supported by a viable financial model, my assessment is that Bright Kids is a mediocre service provided by money driven people who don't seem to understand that this BS thing they are calling a prep course doesn't have any of the structure and criteria that it takes to really be one. I would never ever recommend them to anyone.\",\n",
       " 'I was referred to Bright Kids by a friend had an incredibly disappointing experience.   After the diagnostic, we were matched up with a tutor after I explained my daughters needs .  It was important to me to get a good match from the start because I  wanted to my daughter to have continuity throughout the sessions and one person who would really get to know her and help her improve.  I explained this at length and our account manager assigned us to someone. My daughter left the first session feeling she did not learn a thing.     Thinking she was resistant to a tutor, we attempted a second session and after some prodding, found out that the tutor sat across the desk from her, acted annoyed at questions and was very poor at explaining and clarifying points my daughter had trouble with.   In effect, rendering the 90 minute sessions useless.   We were sent a report after the first sessions and the reports lacked depth and substance. When I expressed my disappointment, we were given a different tutor and while the account manager was responsive in aligning us with someone new, they took no responsibility for the poor tutoring my daughter received at her first two sessions.    There appeared to be no consultation with management or any attempt to address my concerns other then refer to the no refund policy.    I have to agree with earlier reviews that the policy seems to be clouding their need to address specific issues and complaints and take responsibility for sessions and tutors that fail to execute.  I highly recommend NOT bringing your child to bright kids.   The management at this facility exudes no integrity and the program is inconsistent and has many fail points.   For the cost per session, there should be accountability and the involvement of management to resolve parent issues.',\n",

This tutoring outfit (I won\\'t even mention the name) after the assessment, goes through the materials that she had learned the previous grade level!!! why and what then is this assessment that costed the precious resources for???.  i should have used the money on family trips.  My daughter would spend quality time enjoy playing and relaxing before her exam.  It will probably uplift her energy level for her real challenges.

       " 'I have been bringing my son to Bright Kids for several years, beginning with the Summer Preschool Program through prep for all of his kindergarten application testing (ERB, Stanford Binet, G&T).  He loves going and always has a great experience.  The results speak for themselves (99X3 ERB, invited to Round 2 of Hunter...); whether or not he would have had these results without Bright Kids, I will never know, but I am very happy with the way Bright Kids helped to prepare him for these testing situations, if anything just the practice of sitting in a room with an adult stranger and answering questions.  Some of the previous reviews have brought up valid points.  Yes, the services are very expensive, and I did notice that from one tutor to the next there didn\\'t always seem to be continuity or real knowledge of his initial assessment or his previous session (this was not always true, it varied from tutor to tutor).  But overall, I am very happy with the service.  Everything in NYC is expensive, and the fact that the tutors are certified teachers (all of whom, by the way, are stellar, from what I could tell) is something I\\'m willing to pay for.  The lack of continuity didn\\'t really bother me (and again, often there WAS continuity, it was only the occasional tutor who hadn\\'t seemed to have done his/her \"homework\" - reading up on my son\\'s past session reports or diagnostics), I always felt the review was helpful and areas needing improvement were always identified in each session.  I may feel differently if my son were older and preparing for a different type of test, but he\\'s 4, and these tests are very subjective, the biggest challenge being sitting in a room with an adult and being well-behaved enough to thoughtfully answer questions, which each tutoring session at Bright Kids gave my son the opportunity to practice.  Scheduling and billing-wise, there was always plenty of communication.  I was always able to easily reschedule anything I needed to reschedule.  I was issued refunds when scheduling didn\\'t work out for whatever reason.  I was always reminded of my sessions and billing via email.  The communication was very straightforward and all questions/issues resolved quickly and easily.  Overall, I would recommend this service to anyone seeking preparation for pre-school-aged children.  I can\\'t speak to the services for older children, as I have no experience with them in that regard.  I intend on enrolling my younger child in Bright Kids\\' offerings as soon as she is old enough.  I have not found any service that offers the same level of instruction at a similar cost.  I highly recommend Bright Kids NYC!',\n",

One of the tutors was also an hour late, although that's not a big deal. Definitely not recommended.\",\n",
       " \"Our family has been working with Bright Kids since our son was four  - he is now almost seven. We have been homeschooling since 2010 when my husband was posted to New York. Our son is bright and we wanted to create an environment where he could learn at his own, perhaps faster pace and in a focused, efficient way. We wanted to work with tutors both to ensure that we were on track with the curriculum and to supplement and support my own teaching.  For almost all those three years, we have worked with Bright Kids' teachers Lisa B. and Nicole G. Both have been amazing, dedicated teachers who have worked incredibly hard and enthusiastically to offer support to our family. They have watched our son grow and have helped him to grow and have felt like part of our family. They have worked on almost everything with our son - supporting our work in maths, writing, reasoning, reading and offering a wide array of subject lessons from science to geography. They have been flexible in focusing on what we needed at different times, providing their own materials and ideas. I have observed almost every one of their lessons during those three years, yet still they would write reports afterwards summarising the lesson. The agency has been great about communicating with us about schedule changes and other issues. Our son has loved working with Lisa and Nicole. Thanks to their efforts and dedication, our family has been able to offer our son a tailored education that was just what we wanted for him.  Certainly, we are working with the agency in a different way from many people - as homeschooling support - but we have found that Bright Kids has offered us exactly what we wanted. They even found us a wonderful french teacher, Lisa C, when we decided we wanted to add that subject. We should mention, that our son recently sat a UK private school exam of three hours. Of 250 children who sat, 40 were selected for interview and our son was one of them. He came 10th in an exam at another private school. We were really trying for the top schools, so this was a genuinely tough test both of our son and his schooling. We are now looking forward to him attending one of the highest regarded boys' pre prep schools in the UK.  I will miss homeschooling more than I can say (and our family will keep one foot in the US because we intend to come back one day).  I am very grateful to Bright Kids for finding us such excellent, loyal and supportive teachers in Lisa and Nicole and for helping us to make homeschooling a wonderful, warm and happy experience for our son.\",\n",
       " \"We have been using Bright Kids, Upper West Side, NYC office since 2012. First we used Bright Kids for my older daughter to train for G&T program.  We went back to Bright Kids this year again for my younger daughter. My older daughter eventually made it to the program. Sessions' registration process took me 5 minutes only. It was easy, fast and straightforward. We were a little late this time with the registration for my younger one. Almost all spots were taken already. Nevertheless, the administration worked with us personally to accommodate our desired schedule to the maximum! First day of the classes we came to a very welcoming office. The staff at Bright Kids is the best - very welcoming, helpful, resourceful, supportive, professional. We had different teachers for each session. I find this strategy to be a very good training for kids to get used to be around different tutors. This helps them not to stress out on the actual test day. All the teachers were great! We liked the fact that after each session we were receiving written performance reports. This is a very helpful information to make your estimations on where your kid stands in the process of learning. Another helpful tip is that after every session parents are having brief consultations/reviews with tutors on how did the session go, what was the most challenging part of the session, what was done independently by kid and what with teacher's help. Teachers also advise parents on what to pay attention to while prepping at home, on what strategies to use etc.  Bright kids have variety of resources regarding G&T test preparation and I find their books being the best. Even if my younger daughter ends up not making to the program she still benefited from the whole experience of learning. By any means I would recommend Bright Kids and use them again if needed.\",\n",

The Bright Kids account managers were very helpful and knowledgeable, giving us advice every step of the way. First of all, the diagnostics and the progress tests were great. I also like the fact that  Bright Kids creates their own materials and curricula.  In addition, we received $200 worth of books with the package we purchased.  Initially we were worried that the teachers were rotated, but what we realized at the end that our child was very comfortable with working with different teachers, which was invaluable at the end.  Our child had no problems walking in to the test with a stranger and completed the test with no issues, even though he had some separation anxiety at the beginning.  The teachers were great at making him  comfortable and were able to engage him immediately.  We honestly were a little stumped by some of those G&T questions at first, and I was amazed at how confidently my child was working by the end! Our son scored a 99%, and now is in a citywide G&T school.  What I liked also was that their support continued after we got the score.  Bright Kids helped us rank the schools, explained the differences among the programs and even hosted conference calls to answer questions.    Fast forward three years, and we back at Bright Kids for our younger child who just started to prep for the G&T.   She had a lot of separation anxiety initially but the teachers at Bright Kids worked with her and now she walks in to any sessions without hesitation.  We hope she will join her brother next year at his school.  Don't be fooled by people who say do not prep for the G&T; the questions are hard and it requires a lot of stamina to do well.

Don't be surprised if your child does the same material each lesson. They are greedy and don't run their business with any ethics whatsoever.

I honestly learned so much in the short week that we had together - it took me from a place of being afraid of the GMAT to really thinking that it was an enemy I could combat using the curriculum and the amazing instruction of Ethan.  Not only does Ethan bring an incredible amount of experience with the GMAT but he's not about giving you only the tricks that will solve very specific questions on the GMAT (thought he does give that as well), but he is also about learning how to take the GMAT in a more holistic way where you can really understand what the test is trying to learn about you - and redress the style with which you approach it accordingly.  I had taken the course before with another teacher and while this instructor was solid, I really think Ethan brings it to the next level. I truly believe he was one of the best instructors I have ever had in all of my academic life.\",\n",
       " 'Having great test materials and handouts are the easiest things we can all get access to while preparing for the GMAT. But to help you prepare, by breaking down the content and strategies in a simple and effective way is a hard task. And Ethan truly has mastered this art and makes learning so much fun. I was a skeptic of online learning till I took this course with Ethan. After a long workday, the last thing you want to do is sit down for a boring lecture for 3 hours, but my Veritas prep classes were a breeze. Kudos to Ethan & Chris Speck who made it fun.    Ethan manages to convey the key message behind preparing for the GMAT, \"Think like the test maker\".  Thanks to him and the Veritas Prep team for offering a quality course. I sincerely recommend it.',\n",
       " \"Ethan has a unique ability to make 3 hours feel like 30 minutes.  He's knowledgeable (quant & verbal) and has a ton of energy.  I highly recommend Veritas Prep and Ethan.\",\n",
       " \"BLUF: I would recommend this instruction to anyone looking to increase their GMAT score, but cannot attend live classroom instruction.  The live online instruction was excellent in its quality of content.  For someone like myself who was overseas and located in a place where classroom instruction was not possible, it was a great choice.  However, the internet connection I had was not the greatest and therefore I experienced consistent lags in the streaming rate.  This resulted in myself missing some of the finer teaching points that Ethan (my instructor) was attempting to communicate.  This would occur for the duration of the 3 hour class, and it left me very frustrated at times.  The recordings had the same issues.  So, if your internet connection speed is average to below average, I would think twice about spending over $1500 on this option.  The Veritas Prep Books are excellent themselves as standalone teaching guides.  Instructor Review: Ethan was excellent.  His personal tips, tricks, and methods that he adds to the standard Veritas instruction were instrumental in my 70 point increase.  Ethan gets the highest recommendation possible, along with his TA Chris.  Prospective students should attempt to get into Ethan's class as much as possible.\",\n",
       " \"Veritas Prep is great. I just don't think it's worth the price tag. I've been studying for the GMAT for about three weeks and I already finished all of their practice questions. I never imagined their material would be inadequate because of all the great reviews despite it being one of the most expensive test prep out there. But it seems like I'm gonna have to spend extra money to buy more books. Since I took the course as a beginner, the classes provided a good introduction. But I wouldn't recommend it to someone who's already familiar with the exam, since they focus on the basics rather than advanced strategies.\",\n",
       " \"I really enjoyed attending my GMAT online course. I signed up for the 7am-10am PST Saturday and Sunday's section with Ethan since it was the only class time that fit with my schedule. I was a bit hesitant attending a online course because I tend to get distracted but the online class is so interactive that I was focused the entire time. Ethan is the best instructor I've ever had! If I had more professors like him during my college years I would've attended every single one of my classes. He is very engaging and makes the most boring and difficult topics such as data sufficiency and sentence correction easy and painless. The handouts he provides are a huge timesaver. Overall after taking this course and doing all the homework and practice questions that come along with the course I increased my score over 100 points. Thanks Ethan!\",\n",
       " \"I took a prep course from another company and Veritas was by far superior in terms of their instructors and online technology. Everything worked seamlessly and they did a good job of re-creating the virtual classroom environment.  First, Veritas sent me all the course material including books and other miscellaneous material before the class started. The first class was more of an introduction as to what to expect, how the test takers think, an overview of strategies, etc. You are expected to complete the subject specific skill builders before each class to re-acclimate yourself to the material and strengthen your foundational knowledge. During class, we went over the content, time saving strategies, thinking about problems logically, getting a better idea of how the test makers think and doing homework problems. The class itself was very interactive. You can raise your hand and ask questions seamlessly as if you were sitting in the same room as your instructor. Once the course has concluded, you are allowed to access the video recordings of each class session up to 60 days from the end of your course.  I was a little hesitant taking the GMAT Veritas prep course given their high price point, but you get what you pay for quite honestly. By far the best test prep course I've taken to date. I chose to take Ethan's class based on some of the stellar reviews I read. Ethan is the absolute best! Let me start by saying his personality is extremely warm and inviting with the perfect amount of humor that makes sitting in a 3-hour online class rather enjoyable. His passion for the GMAT and helping students achieve optimal success is genuine and palatable. He truly wants to see you win. He consistently emailed me throughout the course to see how things were going and he continued to do so well after the class had ended. He didn't have to go the extra mile, but he did and it put me at ease knowing I had someone else invested in my success. He didn't feel like my instructor, but rather a partner in helping me achieve optimal success. Don't play yourself. Give Ethan a shot and you won't be disappointed.\",\n",
       " 'I think they have good material - videos and practice problems - however, the \"office hours\" are useless. The instructors that run them will send you to a website to figure it out on your own or answer your question the same way the video does and move on so you are still back at square one. That being said, Veritas is really no different from any other gmat program.',\n",
       " 'Love love LOVE Veritas Prep! From the course material to the online live class to the on the go app!  I thought the course material was very well scaffold. As a former math teacher, I found the set up to the course completely comprehensible. The questions and problem sets were even well placed as they built up to the toughest/most confusing problems, just as the problems on the GMAT. The full length practice tests were closely aligned with the real GMAT, I was not surprised at all on test day. My instructor, Ravi, was straight forward and did a great job of applying the real world to the problems, which really made all of the difference. I love that he approached every problem type as a strategy and how they all repeat essentially in one way or another. As soon as I figured that out, it was like a light bulb went on and I jumped about 100 points on my practice exams over the course of the exam. I take my exam next month, I am sure I will perform 10 times better than I did prior to the start of this class.  Thanks Ravi and David for helping to push me to see the POSSIBLE in what seemed IMPOSSIBLE: understanding the GMAT.',\n",
       " \"I am so glad to have been paired with my GMAT tutor Steve Odabashian.  We meet online a couple of times a week.  He is a truly a professional who excels in his craft.    I would be going crazy right now if I didn't have his guidance.  He is very good at recognizing my weak areas and making suggestions about what to study in order to improve.  He also points out where I am improving so that I see my progress.  And let's be honest, he does a great job of making me laugh when I'm about to tear out my hair.  Along with Steve's tutoring I am quite impressed with the Veritas Prep materials (and Steve's knowledge of them).  The content is intellectually accessible, yet challenging.  And as a former educator, I love that they use Bloom's taxonomy to explain why they teach how they teach.  Pedagogy at it's finest.\",\n",
       " 'I took a live online course with Ethan with Chris Speck as our TA. I was wary before taking the course for a few reasons. First, I had already taken a Manhattan Prep course and I hadn\\'t seen a score improvement. Second, it was an online course and I thought it wouldn\\'t be as good. Finally, I didn\\'t think anything could help me improve my score.    Well.  Ethan (ET) was an AMAZING teacher.  He brings the class to life, is incredibly engaging, and is hysterically funny. I have a full time job and work 11/12 hour days which is all to say that I\\'m exhausted when I get home. So it\\'s a true testament to how excellent a teacher ET is that I am excited to learn and feel 100% engaged by the material he\\'s teaching (my course was from 8-11pm).  I can\\'t speak highly enough of him. During my practice tests I hear him in my head saying: \"NOBODY EXPECTS THE DIFFERENCE OF TWO SQUARES!!\" And I know people talk about his great fool\\'s strategy but seriously, it sticks with you and it\\'s hilarious. His strategies stay with you during the test. Believe it or not, he makes studying for the GMAT (well, GMAT class at the very least) fun and makes the test feel beatable.  He\\'s excited to teach and it comes through the screen. Take his course, you won\\'t regret it. I thought I was a lost cause but in the 6 weeks of his class, I improved by 70 points (!!!!) and I\\'m not done yet! Still not at my dream score but I CAN TASTE IT.  Chris was extremely helpful and provided great feedback throughout the course. He would check in during class to make sure you were understanding. To add to that, I emailed Chris and ET a few times with questions and updates. Both were very helpful and Chris\\'s responses were amazing. He answered every aspect of the question and sent me very detailed responses, helping to comfort my fears and sending useful tips on how to study.  The only negative is that the MGMAT foundational books are more thorough for people who need to learn the math skills than the Veritas books are. But after you\\'ve mastered the foundations, Veritas does a far better job of teaching you how to actually take the test.  The strategies for taking the GMAT that Veritas teaches are excellent. I am NOT an engineer or a finance kid and while I do math for my job, it\\'s mostly percentages and I hadn\\'t taken a math class in 6/7 years.  ET and Veritas teach you that this is actually a logic test and the idea is to do as little math as possible. In fact, when I see a complicated problem, I know to pause, think of Ethan (WWED) and consider what this question is actually trying to test. So thank you.    To calm people\\'s fears about an online course, it\\'s actually extremely convenient and it\\'s as engaging as you make it. You won\\'t get cold called (maybe other teachers do that but ET doesn\\'t) but you\\'re very engaged. Any questions you have, any at all, you just type into the chat box. I loved my fellow class mates and we all interacted very well together. ET and Chris created a points system (not sure if other teachers do this as well), which helped to foster classroom interaction. The system was excellent and my computer, which normally can\\'t handle a basic skype call, was perfectly able to live-stream the class. I never encountered disturbances in my connection I was unable to fix with a basic refresh, which only needed to be done during one of my classes. I don\\'t know what kind of magic you Veritas people are working but it\\'s great.    HIGHLY recommend this course and take it with Ethan! HE\\'S THE BEST!!!!!',\n",
       " \"I chose Ethan as an instructor because I heard from the veritas prep office that he is very energetic and engaging as a teacher. He also scored a 780 on his very first exam (which he took without any intentions of applying to business school, and didn't study for), which is a testament to how well he fundamentally knows the logical thinking required to do well on the GMAT. Ethan emphasizes that this exam is a test of your logical thinking skills, not how well you know math or grammar, and really hammered that into our heads. He has his own clever ways of tackling problems outside of the course curriculum that supplemented our learning. Lastly, he was always so energetic and kept me entertained and amused by his humorous antics. He's very nice, never talks down on anyone when they get a question wrong, and genuinely wants everyone to learn and do well. Definitely attend his classes, do not just watch his recordings!\",\n",
       " \"Veritas Prep is an amazing GMAT prep experience. It is evident that the organization gave careful thought to the structure of their student experience, from the sales experience, to the comprehensive online student portal, to the creative (and sometimes appropriately wacky) teachers. During the sales experience, I spoke with someone over the phone and he quickly answered all of my questions and then some. He also followed up diligently and concierged me into the experience (I purchased the package about two or three weeks before the course started and the sales associate helped me get up and running during that lead up time).  Once you enroll, Veritas Prep gives you access to an online student portal that houses a study plan, practice tests, practice problems, videos and recordings of your class. I found this one-stop shop very intuitive and helpful to help organize my efforts (because we all know that GMAT studying can go in multiple different directions). They also sent me 12 dense lesson books; spend the time to read through them, they have some good content in there. I really liked the philosophy of Veritas Prep (focus on strategy and reasoning, rather than content memorization). A previous course that I took did not touch on strategy at all and I think that's what prevented me from realizing my fullest potential.  I took an online live class with a teacher by the name of Ethan Todras-Whitehill. He is a little bit out there, but at the same time, you almost need someone like that to help bring the content to life, engrain it in your mind so come test day you remember certain techniques. The classroom environment he created was extremely collaborative (I've never taken an online course before, so I was pretty impressed with the technology as well). Ethan also went 'off-book' at points, supplementing the prescribed Veritas Prep material with his own creative slides to help further enforce the strategy and content. Ethan also focuses more on strategy and helps you understand why strategy is so important on the GMAT. At first I didn't trust some of the strategies, but once I gave them a try, I became a believer....THEY WORK! It's evident that Ethan has invested additional time to facilitate a robust learning experience, which I can say was effective at engaging me and keeping me coming back for more.  All in all, i'm in believer in Veritas Prep and would highly recommend the course.\",\n",
       " 'Veritas:  great material, great value, highest quality. Veritas NYC (With Chris Kane):  Chris is brilliant, but that\\'s enough.  To me, a teacher should be brilliant, informed, and a great communicator.  Chris is all of the above.  Chris moves fast and you should not be a dummy to participate.    If you\\'re not a dummy, and want GMAT instruction to help you achieve a top-tier score, sign up for Veritas.  I have experience with other test prep material, and it doesn\\'t even come close (content, quality and effectiveness are all better with Veritas).  Now, I should qualify this, I don\\'t want to scare away the weak.  When I say \"dummy\", I\\'m referencing the students that come to GMAT class and get bogged-down by simple arithmetic.  While you\\'ll learn some shortcuts and strategies in this department, you\\'re doing a disservice to yourself and others by not refreshing this on your own.  If you\\'re current, and can add, subtract, multiply and divide, you\\'ll be fine.    Good luck',\n",
       " \"First to Review Looking at Kaplan and the rest, I decided to go with Veritas Prep because I felt they had an unexplainable edge on the rest, as well as their approach.  I got the study materials, and they looked very professional.  This encouraged me knowing that perception is reality.  I went through the Veritas on Demand courses, in which you can go through pre-recorded classes online.  Then I went back through the practice problems, and went to take the test.  I spent about 1 and a half months studying just the OG, and then I decided my studying was getting to where I wanted it to.  Thus, I switched over to Veritas for another month and a half and I took the test.  Everyone there was very nice and even offered a military discount (which I am always appreciative of).  Anyway, included is an excerpt from a letter that I wrote back to Veritas after taking the GMAT:  I definitely wanted to spend this time to give you guys a debrief, people who I believe had a big part in getting the score I did. Ed and Valerie (who answered questions on the homework problems), thank you so much for your incredible patience with all of the questions I had on ... Well, everything!  And thank you for your encouragement after the discouraging practice test scores. And Peter, thanks for taking an interest in me when I first called Veritas in wanting to get more information about the program and continuing to encourage me and help me along the way.  I thank God for providing me you guys to help me along my journey in the MBA process and hopefully we'll keep in touch!\",\n",

He advised me that my daughter would be too young for the establishment and went completely out of his way to not only send me links to resources, but also gave me advice on how she can bring her grades up.  On this alone, this center is A+! I am hoping to bring my son here in the near future as he is in middle school.  Thank you Calvin and Premier Aptitude and I wish you much continued success!',\n",

The tutors kelvin and Eric have really design and evolved the math and science program so as to have students become inquisitive and much more interested in Mathematics without being afraid to ask questions.  My daughter, Alexis has been able to solve challenging problems in advance placement math for H.S. We  couldn't be happier with the results our daughter has archive thus far.

       " \"Having attended several other Asian tutoring/prep centers before, I have never had the same amazing experience that I have at Premier Aptitude. Other centers hold very large classes with teachers that don't seem to care much about the students and the materials that are given seem to be read word for word from a textbook. At Premier Aptitude though, I have deeper sense of connection and understanding between the teachers and me. Attending classes at Premier Aptitude have not only helped me perform better academically, but have given me a boost in my self-esteem and mental image.  In my mind originally, I had thought that Premier Aptitude would be like other prep centers. The 7th grade me had prepared myself for the constant beating down of self-esteem and dread that I had when I usually had when attending classes. The first class that I had attended though had given me quite a shock.  Calvin, one of the tutors at the center had greeted me with a smile and had welcomed me to join the class. The other students who had already been in the class had been eager to introduce themselves and were at ease. The usual tense atmosphere that I had at other prep centers seemed non-existent and I tried my best to take in everything that was happening. The class size was rather small, but I was able to ask more questions and received more attention for problems I had. Premier Aptitude offers such a wide array of classes such as SAT II Bio, SAT II Chem, AP Physics, College Prep, etc. that it is impossible to not find something for you.  Besides Calvin, you have three amazing other tutors that are at Premier Aptitude and they are Mr. Paung, Lamont, and Eric. All of them are willing to chat and help you with any questions that you might have even if you're not being taught by them and even during their free time. Not only do the people of Premier Aptitude teach you about academics, but all four of the members who help run Premier Aptitude are also very willing to share their life lessons with you as well. Rather than seeing Calvin, Lamont, Eric, or Mr. Paung as just your tutor, they are here to speak to you about anything challenges that you may be facing in life and you will definitely form a real connection them and the students that are around you as well.  Fast forward, I have now finished my first year of undergrad at Boston College. This would mean that I had been with Premier Aptitude throughout 7th-12th grade, and even now, I am still receiving college advice from all of the great workers who make up Premier Aptitude. With the help of Calvin and Lamont, I was able to exceed my parent's expectations of attending a mediocre college and I have been offered many opportunities at Boston College.  If you're looking to form a real bond with people who will care about you as a person, attending Premier Aptitude is a definite step that you should take to improve what you currently need or may need in the future.\",\n",

Calvin was my main instructor and he really turned my life around for the better. I used to barely be a B student before I started going to him but he slowly improved me to an A student. At first, I was frightened by the small class sizes because I was so used to being in huge prep classes where I would just sit in the back and try to breeze by the hours. These small and tight-niche classes allowed me to engage and interact. Calvin believed in my abilities and always encouraged me to be a better student, person, and daughter. Eight years later, I am now a fresh college graduate from my dream school and have obtained my first dream job......all thanks to him. I recommend this tutoring center to anyone with children/ student who might need extra help/explanations outside of school. All the instructors at Premier Aptitude are amazing. They are patient, engaging, helpful, inspiring, and funny. In fact, they made learning for me fun (as crazy as that might sound). Knowledge is power!!\",\n",

       " \"I started going here when I was in fifth grade, which is a lot younger than many of the other students. I went to three other tutoring centers before this one, and none of them were a good fit for me. Mr. Paung, Calvin and the rest of the tutors made themselves readily available for me and coached me through the rest of my schooling, up until I graduated high school. Calvin made sure I had a good foundation for all of my classes, so that I would never fall behind and if he noticed that I was struggling, he wouldn't hesitate to find extra time out of his day to help me and explain to me whatever I needed help with. Calvin taught me high school biology, chemistry, physics, geometry, trigonometry, and I continued onto calculus with Mr. Paung. When I had to apply to colleges, Calvin helped me with the SATs, ACTs, and Lamont helped me with all of my college supplements and essays. The two of them definitely had a major hand in helping me get into my dream school, which is what a good tutoring center should be about. Not only have I developed a strong work ethic here, but I also made friends here that I know I will be friends for life with.\",\n",

But then, I met Calvin and the rest of the tutors and I can't begin to tell you how much they have helped me since. Now, I am a sophomore in high school and because of them, they transformed my grades from a 68 avg student to a 94 avg student. All the tutors and staff members treat you like family. They make learning entertaining to the point that you don't even realize that ur being tutored. This place is honestly the best tutoring center ever.\",\n",
       " 'This place, their tutors, and their staff changed my life and the lives of so many of my friends. Growing up in NYC, I had been to virtually all the tutoring centers out there. My experience with all the other traditional tutoring centers was medium to large class, boring teachers, constant drilling, lots of homework, and lots of tests; the goals of which were to get us into \"the right\" kinds of high schools and colleges. I never felt like I learned anything, but that all changed when I found Calvin, Lamont, Eric, and Mr. Paung. All of their classes were fun, dynamic, and didactic, not just for teaching us material related to school, but also for life. They are, hands down, the most awesome tutors I have ever had. They are easy going, super nice, and they always place the needs of their students first. I learned algebra, geometry, trigonometry, biology, chemistry (Regents & AP!), and physics from Calvin and I really like his classes because he always explained things in a very simple and clear manner in significantly shorter time than any of my teachers or other tutors. He is also very caring, \"punny\" and funny, and just overall, very fun to listen to because he shares his personal experiences, which are often times funny and useful to our lives. I learned AP Physics With Calculus with Eric, who is clearly very knowledgeable in everything related to math and physics because Eric was able to solve something my AP Physics teacher was stumped on! Lamont helped me with the college process, which started out immensely daunting, but then became a breeze with his guidance. His essay comments and suggestions were so helpful that I was able to do everything in a very calm and structured manner. Lamont is super smart and deeply insightful and was able to get us to write about things that were so raw. And...let\\'s not forget Mr. Paung and his antics. Class with him was always full of laughter because of the jokes that he made. Class with Mr. Paung was always intense, NOT because he was a strict person, but because I felt like I would learn so much in just two hours even with all this jokes. I cannot go on about how much they helped ease my academic life and how much they helped me become the person I am today. I have become much more open minded, learned to appreciate puns more, and more confident in everything. They reshaped my attitude and my confidence in a way that I never imagined possible. I highly recommend anyone considering tutoring to try them out. You won\\'t regret it! Waiting area! Love the brightness of everything here!',\n",
       " \"Hands down, one of the best tutoring centers in my opinion. I have been coming here for 6 years now and Calvin is one of the nicest and most patient person you can meet. When you first go into a class, you automatically feel welcomed. He goes out of the way to introduce you to everyone and make it less awkward. His immense knowledge of everything and his interesting stories will keep you interested in class no matter what subject. Before coming to Calvin, I was always lost in class for I was afraid to speak up but here, I don't relate to him as a teacher, but a tutor who honestly care about your problems. Besides Calvin, 3 other people teach here; Lamont, Eric, and Mr. Paung ( Calvin's father) If you ever talk to them, they are the most down to Earth people you will ever meet and will help you no matter what problem. Everyone here will make time for you if you need help, and will adjust their schedules to your needs. In the past, Calvin has made time to teach me one on one geometric proofs, organic chem, and more. He offers tutoring on everything from algebra to APs, SAT I, SAT II, as well as advice on college applications. I definitely do not regret coming here. Coming to Premier Aptitude and having Calvin, Lamont, and Eric in my life has made a great impact on my school grades as well as my life in general. Do not think twice about coming here, because this is the best place on Earth.\",\n",
       " 'Premier Aptitude is definitely one of the best tutoring centers in New York.  Before entering college, I was sent to many tutoring centers in Flushing, Manhattan, and Long Island.   At other tutoring centers,  the learning conditions were not ideal as the walls and floors were dirty and the whole place looked rundown.  However, Premier Aptitude has a clean and sleek learning space that makes me feel good while I am learning.  At other tutoring centers, the teachers were very mediocre because they were not empathetic at all and gave up on the students who were struggling, while helping those who were more excelled.  Other times, the teachers would just give students  a packet of questions for them to do without any teaching or little explanation.  However, at Premier Aptitude, Calvin and Lamont are both very kind and understanding.  What really sets them apart from other tutors is that they do not make the distinction of being your \"superior\".  They try to become friends with you and make time in their schedule to sit down with you to hear your problems and what you want out of your experience learning there.  They both know what they are doing because they have been through the same process  we are going through.  These can include SAT, SATII, ACT, AP,  college applications and etc.  Also, they have been honing their teaching styles for more many years to fit the needs of the students. .  Both my parents and I were very satisfied with the results as I was accepted into Ivy League schools, Macaulay Honors, and into the advanced programs offered by colleges.  I am currently attending a school that has offered me full scholarship.

I enjoyed that their group session is a 6:1 ratio (students to teacher). I see progress after each of the session and is in disbelief that hes able to answer complex puzzles and verbal questions.  While the material is a lot of hard work. I see that he enjoys and even look forward to attending his \"puzzle school\" each weekend. Ms Maxine is a delight and all teachers geniuely care about the student\\'s well-being and progress. During the last session, Ms Maxine provided me a list of helpful tips which helped in prepping him for the test. And, the entire staff always answer my questions promptly through email.  Irrespective of the outcome of the score, I think my son walked away with knowledge (logic, vocabulary, critical thinking, etc) which he can easily applied toward his future studies.',\n",

The class had a 3 students to 1 teacher ratio. She was able to feed off the other students energy and build on that, while still getting individualized attention from the teacher. They were very knowledge and personable which is a huge plus in my books. Always gave me insightful feedback on areas we needed to work on and different ways to make it fun & interesting at home. Now my daughter just turned 4 years old & currently in the fall G&T class. I've already noticed a huge difference in her progress. I enjoy knowing that she's learning and actually enjoying it at the same time!\",\n",

I had passed by this place on my way to the park and read their brochures and told them to give it a try. Ever since starting up at this school, hes been picking up reading and writing chinese and speaking more conversational chinese to me and my aunt. Highly recommend this place!',\n",

She came with test prep materials every class. I stayed at my office while they had lessons.

I appreciate their customized  lesson plan for my son who is 3.5 years.  We've left for vacation once and forgot to reschedule the session and when the instructor show up at my apartment calling me, I felt terrible but the tutor was so nice and did not give me any stress.  I knocked off 1 star because they only service families in Manhattan so i had to bring my child to my sister's house every week but its worth it. His teacher in school said he has gotten better and he utters a few words in Mandarin! i am a proud mom.\",\n",

A coworker referred me to this company. Now, my son loves Chinese culture. The teacher worked on different activities with him. His favorite was definitely dumpling making from scratch. We were impressed and it was delicious too. He was very proud of his accomplishments and so were we. Find a tutor from company is much more reliable than find a individual.\",\n",

He was a great teacher- very helpful, gave great suggestions and tips for studying, and overall helped me improve my Quant score by 5 points! I would 100% recommend Sonom for GRE prep.',\n",

Con: I would have appreciated a more thoughtful pairing of tutor/student.\",\n",

I ended up only using 10 out of those sessions and received a refund for the 5 sessions that I did not use.  Loved the service online from Mark. Super quick to respond to emails and very courteous. He even helped me out when I had a credit card issue. I highly recommend them!!!',\n",

Using MyGuru was an excellent experience for GRE math tutoring. My only mistake was that I asked for tutoring too late in my studying and only used them for 4 hours. With that being said, in 4 hours of tutoring, my score went up 8 points. I was pleased that even the customer service was excellent. I contacted Mark on Saturday afternoon and tutoring was set up almost immediately. I had a tutoring session the following Tuesday with Stefan. I was reluctant to do online tutoring; however, was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was using google video and an online whiteboard. There were plenty of visuals and an inexpensive online book we shared so it was easy to follow along. I had 1.5 hours of tutoring left that was also easy to get refunded for. Everything from the first point of contact to the refund was seamless. I would recommend MyGuru to anyone in need of a tutor and would return if I need a tutor again.\",\n",

Mark assigned me a tutor and even helped me with a discount on the hourly rate. Sonam was my tutor and he was a life saver. In just 4 sessions I felt so much more confident and capable. His teaching method is clear and concise. He's straight forward with what to expect and not expect on the GRE. I really appreciate all he did for me. I recommend MyGuru 1000%!\",\n",
       " \"I contacted MYGuru to prep for the GRE exam, and can confidently say that the service I received was well worth the price. In the past, I took a GRE prep course at Lehman College. I was in a classroom that held about twenty other students, and I felt  that this put me at a disadvantage because these test prep courses usually run more on drilling than understanding the material. A good friend of mine took a prep course with Kaplan and had a similar feeling about it.  What I really like about MyGuru is that it's individualized tutoring, where your skill level and knowledge is addressed. Drill prep is great if you know the material, but many people I met who are taking this exam have not been to school for a few years and need to refresh. I had a very positive experiance with MyGuru and recommended to friends and family as well.  Mark, the founder, was always prompt in responding to emails and very helpful. He introduced me to Sonam who was a knowlegable and excellent tutor. I felt that personalized tutoring approach has helped me become more comfortable with the material. I would highly recommend this company to anyone who is debating about doing business with them.\",\n",
       " \"First to Review With so many tutoring options available in the city, searching for the right company or agency to maximize both your time and your dime can be just as overwhelming as passing that test...  I have been in touch with several students who have used MyGuru for advanced math and science training, and they have all reported very positive experiences.  Because MyGuru doesn't have any physical locations (you can meet your tutor at a local library, coffee shop, etc.), it is easy to be apprehensive at first.  But after initial conversation with a Managing Tutor, where they review your demographics and find the best fit for your studying needs, it becomes apparent that they really take your preferences and availability into consideration. Although it may take a full day to process, as soon as you become connected with a tutor you will immediately see that the rest of the experience will run just as smoothly.  MyGuru tutors are true experts. They have been tutoring for many years and many of them have advanced degrees in your field of study. Being able to accomodate scheudles that are constantly on-the-go is additionally impressive. So whether it's for you or for your child, this company will be sure to do everything possible to fit their time into yours.  In a city where focus and concentration get lost in the everyday grind, MyGuru does a great job of making sure you are maximizing your time to master the important stuff. Good communicators, patient  teachers and well-prepared and professional staff... whoever came up with this agency is truly my guru!\",\n",
       " \"My Guru Tutoring is one of the best services I have experienced. Let's face it. We all go on faith when we are going to hire a tutoring service. We flock to Kaplan because they have fancy marketing and it is who we have heard of. But I wasn't convinced. Especially since you pay a hefty premium for individual tutoring, like $300 per hour. But the value isn't there. Kirt is a professional every step of the way. He is communicative and responsive. He is personable and generous. My first tutor was an expert in her craft but poor planning on my part caused a scheduling conflict. Kirt was understanding and arranged another tutor for me. My tutor was the absolute BEST person in every way. When I expressed embarrassment at my low original scores, he reassured me that my score was not reflective of who I was in any way. Those words were kind and helped me stay focused and not bogged down with self esteem issues. It freed me to ask all questions and not be ashamed because I wanted to look smart. My tutor was patient too and could explain things to me as often as I needed without judgements. But here is the best part. After two weeks of working with my tutor, I RAISED MY MATH SCORE 13 POINTS! That's how clear and thorough his instruction was. AND the tutor was clear that we not waste time. I bought the 15 hour package. I used 9 hours. I was offered a refund but chose to keep them because they were available forever without expiration. My son used them for his college placement exam a year later with the same results - an significantly increased score. I have recommended this service to two other people and they tell me they are just as happy.  Bottom line: I will use them again and I would recommend them to anyone who asks!\",\n",
       " 'My entire experience with My Guru was extremely positive. Mark was helpful right from the get go. He walked me through the various options and how to get started. When my first tutor was not a great fit for me he was very understanding and immediately paired me with another tutor, Sonam, who was excellent, and perfectly suited for the kind of instruction I needed. If math is not your forte I highly recommend him. Both Mark and Sonam were always quick to respond, flexible, and eager to help. Definitely worth the money!',\n",
       " 'I can\\'t say enough about this company.  My daughter\\'s tutors were fantastic.  They were always prepared and on time. They had a lesson plan.   It was a full hour of one on one tutoring.   Working with a tutor and her own hard work in preparing for the GRE my daughter raised her score significantly.  She was accepted into a fully funded Phd program.  It is not \"cheap\" to do this but by comparison to other programs it is far less expensive.  If you struggle with standardize tests you need to do this. Considering the result, funding for 6 years, it is a bargain!  So much is at stake with these tests, don\\'t let the extra expense sabotage your dreams.',\n",

       " \"First to Review As most people know, the Project Management Professional (PMP) exam is one of the hardest exams with 200 questions completed over a 4HR time frame. It's not common for people to pass on the 1st try. There are even MIT grads that didn't pass the first time. However, there were many great reviews about Project Management Academy and their preparation methods with respective passing rates. I worked with our organization to get our team to prep and obtain the 35 Hours Education Credits needed for PMP via PMA and was so happy that we did! We took the course in October of 2017. All of us passed the first time and that is due in part to PMA's outstanding course instruction, instructor and materials.

Not only he loved going there but every time a session ended, he would come out with a big smile in his face. He loved the fact that he was being challenged as often there is a lack of that in school system. Overall the course helped him also do so much better in school, during the course of this test prep he was moved to the top honors class in the school and his test school grades are in upper 90s. I am positively sure the Kweller prep helped with the advance. Aside from that, Frances is amazing and treats you like family. They offered lunches during the long weekend classes and I was pretty surprised by that. They also offer complimentary parking. Help is available outside the regular schedule. I took my son for additional help many times without having to worry I had to pay extra. She currently is offering additional prep for the interview all complimentary. I will bring my son back here for sure as well as it's highly recommended. Another note to add is that their material is excellent along with the homework kids take with them. They also offer sessions designed for parents to help them help their children how to study home so they can really be successful with the program. Thank you Kweller!!!\",\n",

       " \"First to Review My two daughters attended NYC public elementary, middle and high schools.  Bee Tutored played a big part in the academic success of my girls, as neither my wife nor I were expert enough in mathematics and science to guide them through challenging patches.  Over six or seven years, we've used an equal number of tutors. Owner Kate Pritchard was extremely responsive and did a good job matching my daughters' challenges with a tutor (usually college aged or recently graduated from college) who had absolute mastery of the subject.  Only on one occasion did we ask for a rematch. Bee Tutored sent over a replacement tutor the following week -- and we continue to use him 16 months later for my daughter, a senior at Brooklyn Tech.  We credit the work of Bee Tutored during middle school, along with SHSAT prep classes, with helping my youngest gain admission to one of the specialized high schools, Brooklyn Tech.  Had the Bee Tutored tutoring center opened several years ago, we would have availed ourselves to their SAT and ACT college test prep, which our girls took at Kaplan.  They found Kaplan sterile and uninspiring, not to mention disorganized.  Test grades were often not posted on time and classes were canceled without advance notice. My oldest daughter saw no improvement in her score from PSAT to SAT, even after taking the Kaplan course twice.  Bee Tutored is the antithesis of for-profit, corporate tutoring mills like Huntington, Sylvan, Kaplan and Princeton Review.  Anytime I have wanted to speak with the owner, Kate, I reached her via email and phone.  She takes pride in her business and the success of kids receiving tutoring from Bee Tutored.  As a longtime customer of the business, I attended the open house for the new tutoring center and met the Scratch computer programming tutor and the SHSAT prep tutor.  They were just like the young adults that have mentored my kids over the years -- bright, warm and eager to teach.    I recommend Bee Tutored to any parent who doesn't have the time and/or skills to help his or her kid with homework and test prep.  They've come through for me over many years and I have two smart, confident daughters to show for it. Located on the corner of 7th Avenue and President Street in Park Slope, Bee Tutored is on the second floor. Nice location. Bee Tutored held an open house to celebrate its new tutoring center in Park Slope. As a longtime private tutor client, I took a look inside.\",\n",

My issue with them was not so much the content but the execution. The tutor who was assigned to my daughter was a very nice lady but would arrive at the sessions late. She would make up the time but I felt it was inconsiderate of her to come late.  She would promise to send work to my daughter via e-mail and I would have to remind her days later  before the documents were sent.

I went to their opening day party (which was lots of fun... they even hired an ice cream truck!) and learned a lot about the business while there. They've certainly won me over.  Han, the head instructor and co-owner, is a veteran NYC public school teacher and Queens native. He teaches great art classes that have produced some extraordinary results, some of which are displayed on the walls (I certainly couldn't draw like that in grade school...). They have other classes as well in  music, yoga, STEM, writing, and family learning. His wife and co-owner, Jenny, a Brooklyn native who has worked many years for an education non-profit, is in charge of management.  On top of being very friendly and smart, they are also parents who live in the neighborhood. It's just great to see a homegrown small business by parents for parents in town that emphasizes enrichment and the personal interests of children -- which is fundamentally different from (and in my opinion preferential to) test prep classes. To my knowledge there's nothing else like this in the area.  I can't wait to send my kid here, and I'm excited to see how this place develops over time.\",\n",

       " 'Brian is an amazingly patient, knowledgeable, and helpful AP Chemistry tutor.  He has helped my daughter tremendously and can not recommend him enough. He is always punctual and  sometimes will email further explanations for problems my daughter finds difficult.  He is a great person and very thoughtful.  I highly recommend him.',\n",
       " 'I found Brian to be really knowledgeable and helpful in explaining chemistry. Definitely recommended!',\n",
       " 'We found Brian through researching local physics/math tutors in the San Diego area. He stood out against others when reading his client reviews and viewing his educational and career resume. When we met him originally we knew we had made the right choice. Brian clearly demonstrated experience with tutoring; breaking down concepts and equations to make relatable in real life. My daughter trusted and respected him immediately; which gave her the confidence in the class to keep up with others. This was invaluable as she has ADD and if she loses grasp of something in class... it can spiral where she loses the entire lesson. The confidence he instilled in her made a big impact. She made it through her freshman physics class and excelled in math, with Brian Ricks help. We hope that she will continue to do well in math, but should she faulted, we know Brian is available. Brian is flexible with his scheduling and he is always reliable.',\n",
       " \"I went through several tutors throughout my three attempts to pass a Calculus II course and initially had bad experiences with tutors getting frustrated with my lack of preparation for and understanding of the material. I was relieved to finally find Brian and stuck with him since!  Brian is always punctual and is flexible with scheduling. He is the most patient tutor you could ask for, and even for someone who struggled with college math as much as I did, he was more than willing to explain concepts multiple different ways until they finally made some sense. I had failed Calc II twice in the past, and I had just one last try to pass over the summer-- and even with a condensed summer version of the course and a professor I thought would make it impossible, Brian helped me to get the first A in math I've had in years! Grateful to have found him.\",\n",
       " \"First to Review Brian was an amazing tutor and worth every penny. Not only did he help me get my first A in a chemistry class EVER, but I'm now working in the field he tutored me in! He was super flexible with meeting times and was always prompt. He loves his work!\",\n",
       " 'My son has been attending Mathnasium of Bayside for about three months now as part of this Mathnasium\\'s 8 sessions a month package. Our commute to here is about 30 minutes but I feel it is worth it. There is ample metered street parking. This particular location (Mathnasium is a franchise and each center is privately owned) has what they call pods; three students are assigned to one tutor. I visited a different center where there was one \"floating\" tutor for the entire time your child is there. For me, this wouldn\\'t have worked as my son needs a little more hands on help and oversight because of lack of ability to focus for long periods of time. Each session is an hour. Children are given binders to keep up with their progress. The center will \"test\" your child\\'s level and help you determine where they would best fit in beginning their math sessions here. Julie, one of the co-owners of the center, has been more than acommodating to us in tweeking my son\\'s individual plan based on what he is learning now in school. The other Mathnasium I visited noted they would only dedicate 15 minutes to homework. My son tutors with Ron and he\\'s been very happy and says he has been able to learn new techniques from him.  It\\'s been three months so thus far am very happy with the center - very friendly, accommodating, polite and helpful. Would definitely recommend to anyone in need of school help.',\n",
       " \"The teachers are engaging and fun. The program is well run and works well with families. My child was always happy to go to math and never once complained about going!

I also have a crazy hectic schedule as I work full time and am also going back to school. Nightmare client. I've never needed/gotten tutoring before so I was pretty skeptical but reached out anyway. Andrew connected me with Amy and she helped me catch up and pass the class. When I moved on to Calculus 2, I thought I might go it alone but quickly realized I couldn't hack it without help. I reached out again and worked with someone new, Teresa. She helped me go from failing the class to getting an A! Without the help of this group there's no way this could've been possible. I'm hugely in their debt.  Both tutors were incredibly kind, patient, responsive, flexible and most of all, helpful. Andrew also is always kind and lightning fast responsive, exactly what you need when you're in a pinch.  We worked together online using Skype and a great little whiteboarding app called Ziteboard. I was skeptical of that too, but it worked SO well and made scheduling so much easier! You pay for classes in a chunk but they practically instantly refund whatever you don't need.  Cannot say enough nice things about Idea Tutors. Thank you!!\",\n",

       " \"This place is so awesome!!! I went here for SAT help when I was a sophomore in high school. When I started, I was terrible and lacked motivation to improve myself and my SAT score was about an 800. I went to many other tutoring schools and also lacked the motivation to study and in other tutoring schools, teachers usually gave up on trying to help me after a while when I refuse to do anything. I thought that eventually, the teachers at PYE would do the same. However, to my surprise, they kept trying to find new ways to motivate me and get me to do my work. I was surprised that they were still concerned about my future and education after I have been refusing to do any work there. The teachers there stayed with me after school and made sure I did my work, I hated that but when I look back to that, I am very grateful for that as it helped me raise my SAT score tremendously and I learned so much. They were willing to stay after school and use their personal time to make sure I understood the things that were being taught. I'm more grateful over the fact that they never gave up on me and cared more about my future than I did. Also, all the staff there are very nice.\",\n",

       " \"I myself studied there with Mr.Steve and Mrs.Lee for more than 2 years. Since my  tenth grade to college. Where I stand now is because of PYE. I honestly cannot thank both the teachers enough. Its a great institution for every ethnicity students with a low cost. Since PYE is family oriented, every student is well taken care.  Everyday, Mr.Steve works with each and every student with their homework, essays and state exams. I myself studied SAT with Mr.Steve and I will tell you that he is one of the best teacher a student can find.  My essays incredibly improved as well as my overall critical thinking.He is also very funny and cracks jokes to make students happy. Moreover, he gives out logical reasoning papers for kids to let them think outside the box which is truly amazing. On the other hand, Mrs. Lee works with little kids up to third grade. She is very patience and kind with kids. Its rare quality people have. I have seen so many little kids who don't know how to read and write, learn how to read and write properly. Even their manners significantly improved a lot.Theres always new worksheets for kids to work on after their done with their homework's.  Mrs.Lee is very understanding and she takes care of the kids like her own children. With such wonderful mentors, theres no way anybody could not benefit from this place. Overall, PYE is such an excellent education centre and I would totally recommend it to everyone with utter pleasure.\",\n",
       " 'I recently learned about Academics West at one of their educational events, where they partnered with an Employee Assistance Professional from Google to educate mental health professionals on their unique style of therapeutic education.  As both a mental health professional-- and someone who had many challenges with mental health as a child, adolescent and young adult--I can say that everything I heard their representative, Scott (who I had met at a previous educational event, and became a good friend of mine) was 100% spot on.  I love their focus on what I consider to be vital aspects of education (which SHOULD be included in all schools, but currently isn\\'t), such as: social skills, individual counseling, art therapy, yoga, occupational therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy, etc, etc.  I was also happy to hear that they offer expressive arts - improvisational skills, poetry, theater, music. Expression is vital for any kid going through difficulties--it is often the lack of self expression that needs to be addressed in order for troubled kids to feel heard, get on track and thrive.  Academics West is an innovative company, employing what they call a \"clinically informed education model\" -- I believe they will set the gold standard for schools nationwide with this model very soon. Handout papers from a recent educational talk given to mental health professionals by Academics West, in partnership with a Google EAP.',\n",
       " \"I can't say enough wonderful things about Academics West/Therapy West. As part of my Case Management services, I have sent many clients to them over the Years. Both Dr Flamenbaum and Dr Kassinove and the team have always spent the time needed to assess and thoughtfully create a plan to understand and help my clients with difficult needs. Cindy Feinberg\",\n",
       " \"Our son has attended this wonderful school for 4.5 years now and to say that it has been a life saver for him and our family would be an understatement! The wraparound therapeutic approach is very effective in that it can tailor the program to best address each student's unique challenges and build on strengths. Our son (with High Functioning Autism, Anxiety/OCD and attentional/learning chellenges) was completely unravelling when he came to them (after attending several other special education schools). At first he required a lot of 1:1 intervention, both in terms of therapy, social support and academics. Now, he is doing so well there and requires much less 1:1 support so that he has transitioned into small group settings for many classes - and that's the beauty of this type of program- it is incredibly flexible. The therapists and teachers are all highly trained and lovely and they work very hard to meet the kids' needs on every level. Our son feels supported and valued and loves his school. His confidence level has soared. As the school grows they are constantly striving to further evolve the program and create a strong, positive community for the students. I love that their philosophy and interventions are based on positive reinforcement. In addition to social groups, OT and speech, the program also includes theater arts, art therapy, yoga and creative writing. There are many different types of students there, some without learning challenges with anxiety or emotional issues, some with ADHD/learning disabilities, some are gifted and some on the spectrum, such as my son. Because the program is so individualized it can accommodate a pretty wide variety of types of students.\",\n",
       " \"First to Review What a waste of time and A LOT of money. Our time there was so frustrating as my ADHD son's behavior regressed badly while there. Please know that I'm not a fan of being negative when reviewing online, but I felt I had to in hopes that others wouldn't make the same mistake in judgement that we did.  Sadly, Academics West seems to have no uniform program in place to deal with a child with ADD/ADHD. As I would learn more on my own, I found myself instructing them on the basics of how to support ADD/ADHD children. I mean, really, how do you help an ADD/ADHD child without structure? I understand each system/school has it's own way to implement, but at least have a system to begin with! Teachers and therapist were lovely and tried hard but without a more structured system/philosophy in place, there was only so much they could be held accountable for.  My opinion is that this place may be better suited for kids with psychological and/or anti-social challenges; I'm not really sure. I can say that our son left there and is now successful in public elementary school.\",\n",
       " 'Five stars are not enough to rate Scholarskills because this program is 10 out of 10. Not only does it fill in the gaps of the educational system that our children are apart of, but it also gives them the tools to think critically and analytically when confronted with new/high-quality material. Since my daughter started Scholarskills, immediately her attitude towards learning has changed. Prior to this program, she had a very nonchalant attitude towards learning and when learning new material, would often back down. However, she has become audacious in learning and is up for any challenge because she now has the tools to thoroughly think things through. Being a part of this program as a parent is also a pleasant experience as I get to learn new teaching techniques, through observation, that I can implement at home. Pastor Vieira and his staff (Joshua and Caleb) are absolutely exceptional in their teaching methodology and are simply good/caring people. They are also highly educated and knowledgeable about the educational needs of your child as each child receives learning instruction and materials based on their needs (other programs give the same work in the same manner to every child despite the child\\'s needs...trust me because this is coming from a parent who placed her child in a number of \"big-name\" tutoring centers.) This is an awesome program...if your child needs help with their academics or as in my case, wants your child to have that \"edge,\" Scholarskills is the place!',\n",
       " 'What a great experience! Scholarskills! has a professional service and we got a fantastic test prep tutor.
