For people like me, it helped me prioritize certain topics and hone in on where my shortcomings were. In addition, Jerry likes to check in with his students to see how they're doing without being too invasive. This helps apply just enough pressure to keep you on task with your study plan.<p>\n",

Prior to prepping for the GMAT with them (specifically, I used their books and did an in-person class with Matthew), I had not done math since high school (almost 10 years). Needless to say, I had to shake off a LOT of rust and couldn't have done so without Manhattan Prep. Their materials are incredibly user-friendly and are helpful throughout the process (i.e., from when you need to be explained things as if you're in kindergarten to when you are tackling more advanced topics/problems). Also, the class is a must - it provided a solid framework/syllabus for approaching the vast topic areas and Matthew provided incredible tips/tricks for approaching the test. Clearly, their help worked - I'm off to b-school in the fall and my ultimate GMAT score was absolutely instrumental in getting me there.<p>\n",

Moreover, they made themselves available to answer my questions and always responded promptly, day or night.\n",
       " \n",
       " While there are many GMAT instructors out there, one of the things that really differentiates Stacey and Brian is their ability to provide tailored guidance to people in all score ranges. When I started out my scores were in the mid-600s. By the end of my preparation, I was scoring in the high-700s. They were able to provide me with foundational tools and guidance that were vital to breaking the 700-barrier and test strategy that helped me reach the upper-700s. Without their guidance, I never would have reached these milestones.\n",
       " \n",
       " The bottom line is Manhattan is a great test prep company and Stacey and Brian are two of the best. If you are serious about test prep (and you wouldn't be reading this if you weren't) I HIGHLY recommend using their services. If is one the best investments you can make.<p>\n",

Manhattan Prep doesn't hold any in-person classes near me, so I had to take the online course. I was a little nervous about it at first because I thought I would get distracted if I wasn't in a classroom. However, I think the online course was a great decision for me. The Manhattan Prep instructors are extremely helpful and make time during class to give you one-on-one attention. There were ~10 people in my class and 2 instructors. The class met for 3 hours every week. The instructors engaged everyone in the classroom by calling on students and making an effort to understand everyone's thought process. The instructors solved practice problems with us, thoroughly explained common mistakes or misunderstandings, and walked through ways to approach problems that I found extremely useful on the test. I felt comfortable asking questions in class and reaching out to the instructors outside of class as well. Manhattan Prep also offers several practice exams with full, worked-out solutions and performance analytics capabilities. In addition to the 9-week online class, the plethora of resources available to me during through Manhattan Prep (GMAT Official Guide, Manhattan Prep books, practice exams, etc.) were invaluable to my success on the exam! I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to maximize their score on the GMAT!<p>\n",

Tutor was slow to reply to my emails, offered no feedback on my practice test. I called to find out if there are any resources to help struggling students improve - there were none. I was told I had to pay to maintain access to the resources while I studied for the subsequent test. The first test I took I had to cancel as I saw no improvement in score.<p>\n",

Prior to prepping for the GMAT with them (specifically, I used their books and did an in-person class with Matthew), I had not done math since high school (almost 10 years). Needless to say, I had to shake off a LOT of rust and couldn't have done so without Manhattan Prep. Their materials are incredibly user-friendly and are helpful throughout the process (i.e., from when you need to be explained things as if you're in kindergarten to when you are tackling more advanced topics/problems). Also, the class is a must - it provided a solid framework/syllabus for approaching the vast topic areas and Matthew provided incredible tips/tricks for approaching the test. Clearly, their help worked - I'm off to b-school in the fall and my ultimate GMAT score was absolutely instrumental in getting me there.<p>\n",

Moreover, they made themselves available to answer my questions and always responded promptly, day or night.\n",
       " \n",
       " While there are many GMAT instructors out there, one of the things that really differentiates Stacey and Brian is their ability to provide tailored guidance to people in all score ranges. When I started out my scores were in the mid-600s. By the end of my preparation, I was scoring in the high-700s. They were able to provide me with foundational tools and guidance that were vital to breaking the 700-barrier and test strategy that helped me reach the upper-700s. Without their guidance, I never would have reached these milestones.\n",

Manhattan Prep doesn't hold any in-person classes near me, so I had to take the online course. I was a little nervous about it at first because I thought I would get distracted if I wasn't in a classroom. However, I think the online course was a great decision for me. The Manhattan Prep instructors are extremely helpful and make time during class to give you one-on-one attention. There were ~10 people in my class and 2 instructors. The class met for 3 hours every week. The instructors engaged everyone in the classroom by calling on students and making an effort to understand everyone's thought process. The instructors solved practice problems with us, thoroughly explained common mistakes or misunderstandings, and walked through ways to approach problems that I found extremely useful on the test. I felt comfortable asking questions in class and reaching out to the instructors outside of class as well. Manhattan Prep also offers several practice exams with full, worked-out solutions and performance analytics capabilities. In addition to the 9-week online class, the plethora of resources available to me during through Manhattan Prep (GMAT Official Guide, Manhattan Prep books, practice exams, etc.) were invaluable to my success on the exam! I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to maximize their score on the GMAT!<p>\n",

I just finished my last class with Victoria and feel confident in my ability attack the GRE. More than that, I went from dreading math to truly enjoying it thanks to her enthusiasm and tutelage.\\n\\nVictoria has every quality of a truly great teacher you can possibly imagine and then some - she really cares about where you're at and how to get you to where you want to be in terms of the material, strategies, and score. I started the class a decade removed from GRE level math and now fully fully confident in my ability to learn any concept and apply the strategies we learned in class to the test. She is incredibly mindful of the class's level of comfort with the material as a whole and always checks in to make sure everyone is understanding explanations, concepts, and strategies.\\n\\nHighly recommended for anyone at any level. Of comfort with the material.\",\n",

With her support, I achieved a strong score and was accepted into both M7 business schools that I applied to. Thank you, Eliane and Manhattan Prep.',\n",
       " '4/3/2019\\nThe Manhattan Prep course was extremely useful in getting me prepared for the Executive Assessment.  I highly recommend the course and specifically my instructor, Elaine Loh.  Elaine was energetic, super knowledgeable, and made preparing extremely efficient.  I achieved my target score thanks to Elaine and the Manhattan Prep materials.',\n",
       " \"12/29/2018\\nI took both the in-person course and the Advanced Live Online course. The in-person course was a great primer to the GMAT and really useful. (I hadn't done much self-study on my own before). The instructor was awesome and I thought the course covered a lot of important information, but I wasn't thrilled with my quant score on the official exam. I used the retake option to enroll in the Advanced Live Online course at a discounted rate.\\n\\nI was thrilled with the Advanced Course -- I had expected the online course to be harder to interact with, but it was a small group and really engaging. The Advanced Quant textbook itself was really great too. My quant score went up from a 42 to a 47 in just 6 weeks.\\n\\nIf I could do it again, I'd probably self-study more from the beginning and then enroll only in the Advanced Course, but regardless I'm really happy with my score and grateful that Manhattan Prep had the options that worked for me.\",\n",

Prior to signing up for this course, I had been self-studying the GRE for about two months while juggling a full-time job that often put me into overtime. When I didn't get the score I was aiming for, I became very discouraged. I initially signed up for just the free trial session, but the positive atmosphere was what eventually spurred my decision to invest my time and money into the full course.\\n\\nThe full GRE prep course is 8 weeks long, and you learn helpful strategies as early as week 1. Jerry is an awesome instructor who really cares about your progress in the class and is really uplifting and encouraging. Sometimes all you need is the optimism and confidence to do well on the exam, and that honestly played a crucial role in my progress. There is also an emphasis on learning multiple ways to approach a problem, so the course can really help different types of learners.\\n\\nPlease note that you really have to consistently study to make progress on the exam. No course is going to magically transform your score if you don't put in the work. But my favorite thing about Manhattan Prep was that the practice exam results tell you what topic areas you need to work on and how long you spent on each problem, which is useful for identifying your weaknesses. For people like me, it helped me prioritize certain topics and hone in on where my shortcomings were. In addition, Jerry likes to check in with his students to see how they're doing without being too invasive. This helps apply just enough pressure to keep you on task with your study plan.\",\n",

I'd heard great things about Manhattan Prep and Rey Fernandez in particular, so I decided to pay the hefty price tag and give it a go.\\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised by the fact that I didn't dread coming to class each week. Rey made it quite fun and there were a lot of really useful tips and tricks. I would 100% recommend Rey's class to anyone looking to enroll.\\n\\nI do think the course is quite pricey, and if you are a diligent self-studier you would likely be more than fine buying the books and working through them on your own. I did take one make-up test and wasn't nearly as impressed by the teacher, so read your reviews carefully. Finally, I do feel that they purposefully make the practice tests a lot harder than the actual test, so keep that in mind if you start getting discouraged!\\n\\nMy score on the actual GMAT ended up being a 710 (91st percentile).\",\n",

Reed was extremely attentive and immediately found small weaknesses in how I approached different problems.  Additionally, he taught me different techniques and changed how I reviewed my work.  He listened to specific issues and designed a program to fit my needs and strengthen my weaknesses.  He made himself very available and even moved around his personal schedule to accommodate me during test week.   I have already recommended Reed to colleagues and friends.',\n",

I just finished my last class with Victoria and feel confident in my ability attack the GRE. More than that, I went from dreading math to truly enjoying it thanks to her enthusiasm and tutelage.  Victoria has every quality of a truly great teacher you can possibly imagine and then some - she really cares about where you're at and how to get you to where you want to be in terms of the material, strategies, and score. I started the class a decade removed from GRE level math and now fully fully confident in my ability to learn any concept and apply the strategies we learned in class to the test. She is incredibly mindful of the class's level of comfort with the material as a whole and always checks in to make sure everyone is understanding explanations, concepts, and strategies.  Highly recommended for anyone at any level. Of comfort with the material.\",\n",

       " \"I took both the in-person course and the Advanced Live Online course. The in-person course was a great primer to the GMAT and really useful. (I hadn't done much self-study on my own before). The instructor was awesome and I thought the course covered a lot of important information, but I wasn't thrilled with my quant score on the official exam. I used the retake option to enroll in the Advanced Live Online course at a discounted rate.  I was thrilled with the Advanced Course -- I had expected the online course to be harder to interact with, but it was a small group and really engaging. The Advanced Quant textbook itself was really great too. My quant score went up from a 42 to a 47 in just 6 weeks.  If I could do it again, I'd probably self-study more from the beginning and then enroll only in the Advanced Course, but regardless I'm really happy with my score and grateful that Manhattan Prep had the options that worked for me.\",\n",
       " \"2 check-ins If I could give more stars, I would. Prior to signing up for this course, I had been self-studying the GRE for about two months while juggling a full-time job that often put me into overtime. When I didn't get the score I was aiming for, I became very discouraged. I initially signed up for just the free trial session, but the positive atmosphere was what eventually spurred my decision to invest my time and money into the full course.  The full GRE prep course is 8 weeks long, and you learn helpful strategies as early as week 1. Jerry is an awesome instructor who really cares about your progress in the class and is really uplifting and encouraging. Sometimes all you need is the optimism and confidence to do well on the exam, and that honestly played a crucial role in my progress. There is also an emphasis on learning multiple ways to approach a problem, so the course can really help different types of learners.  Please note that you really have to consistently study to make progress on the exam. No course is going to magically transform your score if you don't put in the work. But my favorite thing about Manhattan Prep was that the practice exam results tell you what topic areas you need to work on and how long you spent on each problem, which is useful for identifying your weaknesses. For people like me, it helped me prioritize certain topics and hone in on where my shortcomings were. In addition, Jerry likes to check in with his students to see how they're doing without being too invasive. This helps apply just enough pressure to keep you on task with your study plan.\",\n",

I'd heard great things about Manhattan Prep and Rey Fernandez in particular, so I decided to pay the hefty price tag and give it a go.  I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that I didn't dread coming to class each week. Rey made it quite fun and there were a lot of really useful tips and tricks. I would 100% recommend Rey's class to anyone looking to enroll.  I do think the course is quite pricey, and if you are a diligent self-studier you would likely be more than fine buying the books and working through them on your own. I did take one make-up test and wasn't nearly as impressed by the teacher, so read your reviews carefully. Finally, I do feel that they purposefully make the practice tests a lot harder than the actual test, so keep that in mind if you start getting discouraged!  My score on the actual GMAT ended up being a 710 (91st percentile).\",\n",

In addition, if you don't struggle as much with the content but more with specific GMAT strategies, this course would also be a good option. It's not really a course to teach you math/verbal content, since usually the content itself is straightforward - I feel that this is where a lot of other prep companies fall  short, as they spend too much time on the content - but rather the tricks and strategies to help you do well on the exam. Each course also comes with a lot of guides, the OG, and a testing dry-erase pad. The online exams are also extremely helpful to supplement the 2 official GMAC practice exams.

Manhattan Prep instructors are incredibly intelligent, have the most comprehensive understanding of the test, and work with you to personalize your study plan. Chris helped me identify my weaknesses (that I didn't know were weaknesses myself) and improve them to reach my target score. For those who are working demanding jobs while also prepping for the GMAT, Manhattan Prep helps to make your studying as efficient and painless as possible.\",\n",
       " 'For GRE prep: Unsatisfied with the program. I paid $1400 for in class, online, and paper materials. In class: you are with about 20 individuals, teacher spent too much valuable time asking students about their approaches and their fumbling thoughts on the question. Im sorry but as a full time employee and attending these classes after work or on the weekend I would prefer the teacher to focus on more problem strategy, time management, additional relative questions instead of asking us (students) what we think. I dont care what other people are doing. Im relying on this instructor to give me the tools to improve my score. 2) online materials were good, practice sets and questions but to be hones you can get a TON of this for free or significantly cheaper online. Magoosh, kaplan, princeton rev all provide tests even GRE ETS online has practice tests for free. You can even use Youtube 3) paper materials: probably the worst part.You receive SO MANY books and while you may like this approach: keep in mind a lot of professionals are 4,5,10 years out of school. We want an easy methodology to track our day to day practice goals and materials. Manhattan preps GRE course is VERY disorganized with their weekly study goals. It mixes, jambles, and goes back/forth to what questions and books you should be doing. I am not kidding when I say Its a job just organizing what you should study. I can even print and show a picture for anyone who is interested. There are online websites you can use to enter a test date which organizes your daily goal, each section you are to complete, provides the question/answer and poof youre done.  I strongly strongly advise any person interested in an organized, easy to maneuver course for GRE to hire a tutor, gather cheaper paper and online materials and save yourself the inconvenience and cost of manhattan prep. I wish i could get back my money and my time: neither of which MP provides back.',\n",
       " \"Really impressive curriculum. Amazing how I was able to walk in with such a mountain of expectations about the GMAT, then walk out knowing the exact strategies I'd need to succeed.  Having the books alongside the classwork means that, even if I missed something during instruction, there was a bible next to me to pull info from. Plus, their online tools made the Official GMAT Guide far less intimidating. I sampled three instructors, including my Primary Teacher, Matt Brandon, and they all were approachable and energetic.  Now, if you're not wiling to put in the hours on homework each week, this class isn't worth it. They can't train you, they can only teach you how to train yourself.  Everyone I know who's attended a great b-school chose Manhattan Prep for their GMAT studying. I was glad to see find out their recommendation was correct.\",\n",
       " 'Took an in person class for 10 weeks with David Mahler and it was awesome. David was very helpful in helping our class grasp the concepts, strategies and tricks to conquer the GMAT.  There are a ton of books Manhattan prep provides to you that will allow you to focus on every specific topic the GMAT will test you on. The syllabus worked very well with these books and the course and instruction was very instrumental in my GMAT prep',\n",
       " 'Two years ago, I took a Kaplan course and I did fairly well on the GMAT. I was pretty content, but I wanted to see if I could do any higher, so last summer, I took a class with MGMAT with Gregg Lachow. More on him in a minute. But long story short, with MGMAT, my score fell more than 100 points. I then took a break for a few months and then returned and studied all on my own using my Kaplan material, and my score on my third try was the highest of the three. Do with that what you will.  The actual class is $1600 for 9 weekly sessions. Pro tip - if you know someone who works there, they can give you 50% off. You get a lot of homework, which I did and reviewed each week religiously, so you must plan accordingly. Seriously, I have never worked harder before in my life. On the syllabus, there are \"easier\" questions and \"harder\" questions, and I recommend doing both sets each week, in addition to the regular questions. I also recommend beginning to study before you take the class. They provide hundreds of flashcards with questions on them; you won\\'t have time to do this while in class so go through them before class starts. You may find them helpful.  You are given 6 practice tests, and once you finish those, the website regurgitates the questions so you have access to 6 more tests, but with a lot of questions that you will have already seen. So once I began the second set of tests, I felt that my scores weren\\'t very precise; I was more so being tested on taking MGMAT\\'s tests than on the GMAT itself. Also, the syllabus doesn\\'t account for all of the 6 tests, so you may want to adjust it based on when you want to take your real test.  There are several flaws. First, I found several math typos in their books and online material (that I confirmed with teachers). Numbers left out, wrong calculations, etc. This is bad enough when you are dealing with math, but when I emailed them to let them know about this, they not only did not care, but also did not fix them. Second, they only reveal to you after you\\'ve done poorly that you could have had a post-class assessment. And only if you reach out to your teacher once you do poorly will you find out about the post-exam assessment. This should be known to students from the get-go. Third, in class you do 2-3 questions a topic, but this is not nearly enough. I thought class time could have been used much more efficiently to cover more types of questions. Fourth, they offer a room in which you could take your practice tests, but this room is adjacent to a classroom with a very thin wall in between. With earplugs, you can clearly hear the teacher next door, which is very disruptive. And don\\'t bother nicely asking the teacher to please lower her voice. Fifth, my PEA instructor, Chris Peckover, who I had a session with in mid December, created unrealistic expectations for me; he wanted me to take my GMAT again two weeks into January, even though I told him I was going away for a week in December - how this made any sense to him, I can\\'t tell ya. He fully chose to ignore that I was going to be going away and that it wasn\\'t going be enough time. Good thing I didn\\'t follow his plan and waited a few more weeks... Sixth and last, while Gregg is very nice and funny, he could be a much stronger teacher. Also, once he found out that English is my third language, he kept making implications that I had a lot of grammar to learn when, in fact, I knew my grammar better than the entire class...  I really wanted to give MGMAT a higher rating - this is my score and money, after all - but it just wasn\\'t the fine-tuned experience I was expecting.',\n",
       " 'In-person class with Gilad - well worth it. Gilad is a patient instructor with a great sense of humor - a must for how dry the GMAT material can be. Outside of the instruction, the syllabus is a step-by-step guide on how you should spend each week. If you\\'re looking for a spoon-fed approach to GMAT studying, this is your horse. The resources available to students are also extremely helpful, including the post-course and post-exam assessment (try to get Tony, his \"process\" sheets are gold).  My only hesitation on a five-star rating is the cost of the program and my experience with private tutoring. The weight list for in-person New York, especially in the summer, is around the block and my experience with the online tutoring wasn\\'t ideal. It\\'s a hefty price-tag for a two-hour introductory session and I expected to walk away with a customized game-plan. Instead, I walked away with a lot of analogies and strategies that contradicted my course instructor. In short, go for the class and do your research on private tutoring options!',\n",
       " \"I took David Mahler's GMAT class over the summer. The 9 week session was particularly helpful as they identified my weaknesses and helped me improve in those specific areas. I did well on my first attempt and even better on my second attempt.  Strongly Recommended!\",\n",
       " 'My experience with the online private tutoring was horrible. Total rip off instructor was not prepared and I did not see any improvement whatsoever. Find someone else or make you know exactly what you need to focus on',\n",
       " 'I signed up for private tutoring with Mary for 12-weeks. Honestly, it was the best decision I have made. I increased my score by over 100 points. Highly recommend her especially if you struggle in math!',\n",
       " 'I completed a Manhattan Prep GMAT class with Jonathan Schneider last summer (May-August) as part of MBA applications.  I have previously taken the GMAT to get my master\\'s in accounting (MAcc), and am generally skeptical of test prep services, but Manhattan Prep blew me away.  Jonathan was a fantastic instructor.  He was very well prepared for each of the 9 weekly classes, and I actually looked forward to attending them.  Jonathan has a way of breaking each problem into logical components to show you why one answer is more correct than the others, and is great at explaining how to \"beat\" the GMAT by skipping questions, interleaving study topics, and utilizing other test strategies.  My GMAT score increased over 100 points from my MAcc one, in no small way due to Jonathan and the other great instructors at Manhattan Prep.',\n",
       " \"I did 8 tutoring hours with Dan Bernstein and it increased my score by 1xx points (I won't tell you exactly how many; I'm not that much of a braggart.) I'd been out of school more than 5 years and owned a million GMAT books but couldn't figure out how to tackle them with any semblance of organization. I had less than 6 weeks until my test and was in a state of utter panic because I couldn't do any math in a reasonable amount of time.  Basically, the man is a wizard. Well, maybe not a wizard, but just a really patient, approachable math teacher who's capable of helping anyone circumvent a pathological math freeze-up. He's also a pretty cool dude.  And of course, the Manhattan GMAT materials are the best out there. I wasted way too much time with a Kaplan book. Don't do that.\",\n",
       " \"It has been my experience that there are very few services from which one comes away feeling as though they probably underpaid, especially a service as expensive as this however, I must say that this is one of those rare service providers.  The instructors are as advertised: smart, knowledgeable, helpful, accessible, friendly, and (to the extent possible) fun.  The instructors are the core of the service and the company must know this because they must pay well, and otherwise treat their workers well, because they attract and retain such high caliber people who are also really into their jobs.  What I noticed about the instructors is that despite the fact that they are ridiculously good at the test they can teach the concepts to both advanced learners and people who are particularly clueless on a topic.  They have a lot of patience and want to you to ask them the tough questions.  They are also great at motivating you and understanding the stress that you're under as you study for this test.  One time I was in class and I felt that the I knew the subject matter pretty well and I was clearly not paying attention. The instructor found me at the break and persuaded me to pay attention in a very subtle way.    Beyond the strength of the instructors, the prep materials are a key asset of the experience.  They do a great job of breaking down the concepts from a content standpoint and building your base of knowledge while also tying that content knowledge directly to real GMAT practice problems.  There are a ton of practice questions as well, which is important.  There are also tons of extra services that people tend not to take advantage of such as the office hours.  What I found to be a real gem was that if after taking the class you take the real test and don't do as well as you would have liked, the company gives you a free phone session with one of their best instructors to help you get on track.  Furthermore, if you decide you want to retake the class they only charge you $300 which is essentially just the cost of the materials; that's a pretty good deal.  All in all, I was very satisfied with my experience.  I wish that Manhattan GMAT could apply its management techniques to other industries as well.  This is a very uniquely well run business.\",\n",
       " 'I took this in DC, but I can\\'t find anywhere else to rate it so deal with it.  First off, I JUST took the GRE. Like an hour ago. And I did not get close to the scores I was hoping for. I sat through nine weeks of their classroom instruction and my score went down. It went down from what I got when I took my first practice test and did nothing. Now, I know you might think well hey maybe it was just nerves. No, no it wasn\\'t. This class was the biggest waste of money in my life. That\\'s what I\\'m really mad about. Not even the score, but that I made such an \"investment\", put the time in, and got a negative return.  I think the classes might be great if you are border line retared. If you have below a 140, yeah sign up. Just keep in mind that if you don\\'t have a 140 or below and you sign up for this class, you might be in a class with 140s and below. Meaning while you\\'re trying to figure out more difficult problems, they\\'re trying to understand how to cross multiply. I might sound like a dick.....well if I\\'m so smart why didn\\'t I do better? And I agree with you. My point is that for over a thousand dollars, you are better of taking a few practices tests through the ETS book, identiyfing your weaknesses, and spending the money on a private tutor.  This entire standardized testing and prep is a scam and I despise it. I hated in during the SAT. And I hate it now, 12 years later. In closing, it\\'s not worth it. I would have loved to have posted this on their site, but then only put up pre-approved positive reviews.  In fairness, my instructor was nice, competent, and good at teaching what Manhattan Prep puts out. I just think what they put out is garbage.',\n",
       " \"The GMAT prep course here is expensive and time consuming, but well worth the results. I had Josh as my instructor and he was patient with the more challenging topics and prioritized those to avoid wasting students' time on the easier material. The textbooks are extremely thorough and provide lots of practice problems/qs.  If you can afford it, I'd definitely recommend taking the class.\",\n",
       " \"14 check-ins I think Manhattan GRE is the best test prep compared to the likes of Princeton Review, Kaplan Test Prep and Veritas Prep for the following reasons:  1) The instructor teaches the class in an engaging and interactive manner. The class is fairly small consisting of 5-10 students.  2) The course is very structured and course materials are easy to follow. There are 8 books for each topic taught in class. You can go through the books and focus on the area you wish to improve on. There is plenty of homework to prepare you for the next class. After memorizing 49 words per week and reading over 200 pages for homework, one can't help but stock up on red bulls to stay alert.  3) 6 practice exams & daily vocabulary emails from the Blog editor.\",\n",
       " \"I took an in person 8-week GRE test-prep class with Jerry. I can honestly say this was the best experience I have had in an academic setting in a while. If you are anything like myself and have a strong resentment for anything math and standardize testing, this class is the one for you. Jerry is extremely knowledgeable of the content. He is awesome at walking you through each and every step; pushing you to your full potential. The spread out of the class is a lot of work- but surprise it's the GRE! The syllabus, however, makes the entire process less overwhelming and more feasible. If you put in the work, you will most definitely see results. Take it now!!\",\n",
       " 'I took the GRE earlier this week after completing this prep course a few weeks ago.  It was super helpful.  It gave me the structure I needed to stay sane while preparing for the GRE on top of a demanding job.  The instructor for my class - Joe Martin - was great.  He was engaging in class and always quick to answer my emails, even after the course ended.',\n",
       " \"I had two things going against me when I started the GMAT process: 1) I had been out of school for about 5 years, and 2) I am a terrible standardized test taker. I figured if I was going to have a shot at getting into a top tier school, I would need a lot of help.  I signed up for a 9-week, classroom-based course for David Mahler. He was a fantastic teacher. In class, he not only shows you how to do a problem, he explains why other methods are bad or less efficient. In addition to the his incredible lecture method, he helps prepare you for studying outside the classroom. Face it, the course is only 9-weeks - you are going to have quite a bit of prep to do, after the course ends. Having a instructor that will help you build a game plan to test day is invaluable.  One of the competitive advantages of Manhattan is their OG Archer software program. Basically, it is an online program where you answer problems from the GMAC books. The software categorizes all the problems by type and difficulty and it times you as you answer problem, so that after a while you build up a big enough data set to see your performance analytics. You can sort your results by type, time, etc. and the software even creates scatter plots of your performance. In the end, you have a tremendous tool to help you quickly identify the areas where you need to spend the most study time.  While I missed my target score by 10 points, I improved 160 points from beginning to end and was accepted into my #1 school. Now that I am accepted to a top tier program, I don't care that I missed my target. Thanks David, thanks Manhattan.\",\n",
       " \"Loved my GMAT prep experience here!  I'm so bad with standardized testing, it's almost laughable. To remedy this, I took Samantha Lalli's class, which I loved! She was so patient and open to questions.  I wanted extra practice, since I'm so not the testing type, and worked with tutor Matthew Brandon who exceeded all of my expectations! He was so personable, professional, knowledgeable, and flexible with me. My score jumped up significantly and he made what I expected to be a boring and painful process into a fun and enjoyable one!  The company's resources are really top notch. I'm so happy that I chose them as my guides and recommend this company highly to any and all who are preparing for test taking!\",\n",
       " \"I took a GMAT course with Ceilidh Erickson this past fall (Sept-Nov).  Initially I felt the course was pricey, but in retrospect, it was worth it. In terms of course material, you are given a very comprehensive review of all relevant concepts, divided into volumes for each subject that make focusing on a particular area easier; this much is to be expected given the price and reputation. What I found impressive in the layout of the materials was the way it was presented - even the tone that is used in the books. Core concepts and strategies are effectively drilled in a positive and encouraging way, and there is an emphasis on overall test taking technique that is extremely relevant to a test like the GMAT. Included is also a breadth of material outside the subject areas (GMAT roadmap, business school advice, outside 1-on-1 tutoring session, to name a few) that gives you a really good preview of what to expect in the application process.  Ceilidh's instruction and style was excellent. She is exceedingly positive and likable, and her techniques are effective at keeping the class engaged. This was no small feat considering I took a class from 6:30-9:30 on a weekday, a timeslot when, after a long day's work, it was quite difficult to get excited to study. Even in the group setting, where students are always going to be at different levels on different topics, I never felt like we didn't touch a particular topic enough or spent too much time on one (of course students in a class setting need to individually tailor their own study plans).  In the end, there's no miracle course, and I always believe in these types of programs, you get what you put in. I certainly buckled down and put in a lot of hours, and kept up with the assigned work (for the most part). Even so, I can say that I wouldn't have been able to achieve my score improvement without Ceilidh and the Manhattan prep course. I recommend both to anyone looking to dive into the GMAT or improve his/her score.\",\n",
       " \"I took an in-person course with Jonathan last year and - seriously - it is the best thing I could have done to prep for the GMAT. I heartily agree with the other reviewers in my opinion of Manhattan GMAT - they really focused on understanding the material and the test itself, in order to produce the best scores. I thought Jonathan was a fantastic teacher as well - he really took time to help his students and seemed to genuinely care and want success for us. He's whip-smart and knows the test inside and out, and he made each concept easy to understand.  The class itself is a lot of work - don't come in thinking someone's going to do the studying/planning for you. There's a substantial amount of homework each week (about 2-3 hours per night if you space it out) and honestly, don't bother taking the class if you're not prepared to buckle down. There were a few people in my class who came in un-prepared each week and I just didn't get it - it's just a waste of your money to do that.    I took the GMAT three weeks after my course ended, and in the interim I used Manhattan GMAT's resources to review and refresh (they have an iPhone app with digital flashcards which I found really helpful for studying on the go). All that said, I ended up with a 99th-percentile score.  The GMAT can seem like a huge obstacle in the beginning, and even with the help of a prep class it's a lot of work - but it is doable. Manhattan GMAT was a huge help throughout the process for me, and I'd highly recommend them.\",\n",
       " \"Ii think it's overrated or maybe it really depends on instructors. I see a lots of good reviews about couple of instructors. have to ratings: .5 stars for books and tools and 2-3 stars for the course. I took in-person course with Ceilidh Erickson last year. First of it she was bit nervous when she taught, maybe she was new instructor at that point, I'm sure she is definitely knowledgeable. Secondly, the class was boring, even though I was motivated, couldn't wait to leave sooner. If you never studied GMAT before, mgmat is not a good choice. I felt I needed to prepare a bit before I went to took the class.\",\n",

Their online tools are awesome-- they track everything and synthesize all the information for you. They also have test simulation rooms where you can take practice tests. The company is just phenomenal.  The only cons: the elevators in the building are so incredibly slow/broken so you need to arrive about 15 minutes early. Also, the first few classes were in a classroom that had some air conditioning issues that produced loud noises. Not the most conducive to learning.Eventually though, we were moved upstairs to the 12th floor where the AC worked and the classrooms were nice and clean.  I have recommended this company for every single one of my friends who are thinking about taking the GMAT.',\n",

I ended up with a much better score after my class with Rina!\",\n",
       " \"11 check-ins I took an in-person course with Gregg Lachow - I'll echo the other reviewers - you are getting the best GMAT prep course on the market, and Gregg was an experienced and animated teacher.   To its credit, Manhattan GMAT is smart *and* strategic - it doesn't teach shortcuts but helps you home in on your strengths and weaknesses.  And then gives you plenty of additional resources to improve your weak areas.  I was getting pretty pathetic scores on my practice tests - and even on the first GMAT I took *right after* I finished Manhattan GMAT.  But my second GMAT, exactly a month later, was 700+.    Bottom line: put in the work during the course + work with Manhattan GMAT's resources on your weaknesses after the course is over = you should reach the score you want.\",\n",
       " \"1 check-in I signed up for this class in December after feeling a strong compulsion to prepare myself for business school applications. I have a strong college GPA and, solid work experience, however I am awful at standardized tests.  I realized shortly after starting the courses, that my memory of algebra and most of the math was very very slim. I found the online videos really helpful to do alongside the workbook, because I could do it at my own pace. I also found the instructor Jen to be patient and helpful as I moved at a slower pace. I also enjoyed her self deprecating humor. She breezes through the material with ease, that makes me feel like I ride the short bus to class, but then she jokes about being a nerd who spends her free time taking tests, so it takes away some of the sting.  I ultimately stopped taking the classes in the middle, because I realized I was spreading myself way to thin between work and some other things in my life. At this time I have decided to put any business school ambitions on hold, so I never actually took the GRE, however I know for sure from the prep, that there is NO WAY I could go into this test without having done a prep course. If I decided to entertain graduate school again I would certainly  take another course with Manhattan GRE or GMAT. Only reason it isn't 5 stars is because it's pricey and I couldn't get any refund since I stopped after three classes, however they make that perfectly clear when you sign up, so I take full responsibility. It wasn't like I was mislead.\",\n",

Witty, dry humored, intelligent, and most of all excited and animated in front of the class, Gregg delivered week after week.  The course is set up to keep you awake, engaged and learning.  Gregg delivered to all levels of the class, explained difficult concepts with ease and turned the abstract into simple and meaningful stories and analogies.  He is great on math, stellar on readying/verbal, and spot on with writing.  What I also really liked were Gregg's tips at the end of each class about how to get into business school.    GREGG AND MANHATTAN GMAT ARE BOSS.  IF YOU WANT TO CRUSH THE GMAT, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ANYWHERE ELSE.\",\n",

I'd tried out a few other services (Sylvan and Kaplan) but found the people at Manhattan to engaging, interesting, and (importantly) great teachers.  The price, as mentioned, is a little steep, but I guess you get what you pay for.  The class sizes were small, the facilities were fantastic, and our instructor Daniel Yudkin really took the time to get to know us and help us out.  I'd recommend them to friends (and the people of the internet) any day.\",\n",

I believe I wrote on my review to them that I wished that he had been one of my college professors!  Apart from the teacher, every interaction I had with MGMAT employees was professional and helpful, whether it was calling for more information or even emailing them. I liked my class so much that I organized a group class at my company and worked with Evyn Williams, who was fantastic.  The 9-week course included a TON of books, from the official GMAT guide to ones by Manhattan GMAT. It also included access to a variety of testing tools on the website. I used these quite frequently and felt that they were easy-to-use and helped me track my progress.  In all, the price is pretty steep but I luckily got my money back for helping to organize the corporate class. I still think it's worth it for the great customer service, amount of materials they give you, and the quality of the teaching.\",\n",
       " 'Short version: Manhattan Prep is pricey but worth the investment. MPrep offers various test prep options depending on your learning style, such as online tutorials ($), practice tests and books ($), in-person courses, ($$) and individual tutoring ($$$). The instructors are well-trained to teach you effective strategies for identifying various questions types within Data Sufficiency, Problem Solving, Sentence Correction, etc. and selecting / eliminating answer choices based (e.g. avoiding common GMAT traps).  I completed the in-person course at their Chelsea location in February 2016 with instructor Ceilidh Erickson. There are 9 classes in total, 3 hours each. This class is a commitment, as students are expected to follow along the syllabus and complete practice problems outside of class - they suggest 10 hours of studying / week, and I realistically dedicated about 5-6 / week.  My initial practice score was a 600 and after applying what I learned in class for two months, I took the official GMAT and scored a 740. This would not have been possible without Ceilidh\\'s approachable and effective teaching style - her energy is contagious and I actually felt motivated to learn tips and tricks for \"beating the GMAT\". The GMAT itself does not test math / verbal skills above a high school level, but the way questions are worded and set up are meant to trick and trap test takers. Ceilidh equips you with critical timing strategies and answer-eliminating tricks to help you get (or guess) the right question. She is engaging in class and you will find it\\'s hard to zone out (or you will get called out!). I highly recommend Ceilidh and signing up for a free trial class to see if the class is a fit.After each class, she also sends recap emails which are a great refresher before the exam. As her student, you will always feel supported throughout the course, and after - she genuinely cares about your success and want to celebrate when you reach your goal!  Warning: The test is designed so you miss approximately half of the questions. Accept that you will miss questions and that you will have to give your \"best guess\" and move on sometimes, so focus on time management and problem recognition.',\n",
       " \"I took the ManhattanPrep classes early in 2016 and highly recommend the course. The classes and material (books and online portal) were great and helped me study to take the GMAT and get a score over 700. The books and online material are very streamlined so you study in the most efficient manner and don't waste time learning or doing things that won't help. Our instructor, Christine, was a lot of fun. Make no mistake though, the study and homework workload is heavy. I'd say 10-20 hrs per week.\",\n",
       " \"I did both the accelerated 4-week course and private tutoring to get ready for my GMAT, and they both helped me in different ways. The full course really helped me dive into the material and see the range of what I was supposed to know, but I gave myself too short a timeline and was frankly not able to study as much as I needed to get that glimmering 700 I was hoping for. Before the course, I took one practice test and scored an alarming 540- after, I was consistently scoring 650 but still needed to work on my quant. I did private tutoring with Dan Patinkin and it was so great. Dan explained things in new ways and was really patient with me, a total non-quant person. We did tutoring for about 2 months, and when I finally retook the test, I scored a 710!! (V44, Q42). It was a great experience and I highly recommend anyone who is stronger in one area over the other to do the private tutoring as it is so personalized. Thank you Dan & Manhattan Prep, I'm going to the school of my dreams now!\",\n",
       " \"This is a great class for several reasons:  It's small - about eight people in my class, there's a ton of homework, and the teachers (and everyone else working there) are friendly and helpful. Manhattan's process breaks down the test not so that you can weasel your way through, but so that you are able to understand each section as best you can and study accordingly.  I would take this class if you, like me, have been out of school for a few years but your brain hasn't gone soft. They stress that the goal is 170+.  Within my first two weeks of class, my score improved by eight points. Fallacy of causation? Probably not. I'm confident that if I don't score in the 170s in February, Manhattan did all they could, and it's on me.  I didn't give five stars because the homework review books are rife with typographical errors (not just typos, but entire conclusions in explanations carelessly copied and pasted from the wrong question) that will confuse the less careful student; and because of the following:  I must mention this because it cracks me up/infuriates me. Whoever compiled the practice material is quite the Ayn Rand enthusiast. Problems of state control, 'restricted' 'markets,' individual profit vs. societal gain, etc. were inserted into practically every possible practice section; one reading comprehension section I finished just now cautioned against government donations to charity. To me, the weirdness of all this stands on its own without going into the utter moral bankruptcy of the beliefs involved.  It's ironic, since a group of thoughtful people are clearly behind Manhattan's overall process. I highly recommend Manhattan if you're in the market and don't want to be in a massive class. I've also heard first-hand accounts that some other companies don't even teach reading comprehension, which seems dumb to me. May as well have all your bases covered.\",\n",
       " \"This class was so great for me, when I came in my scores were pretty average in the 50th percentile, but after 9 weeks with Joe Martin I scored in the 167 math (above 95% and 160 verbal which I was very excited with. Their practice tests are harder than the real think which definitively helps prepare you for the test, and Joe is really helpful and totally willing to work with you during class and class breaks on questions you don't understand (I was that annoying kid always asking questions), and the guidance he provided in class was amazing. You need to make sure to do all the homework (the 2 important parts each week, but the optional is just that optional, if you don't get all the homework done before classes you are really setting yourself back). Really happy I did this course, and really thankful Joe was my professor, totally worth the money for quality instruction and materials.\",\n",

Easily one of the best teachers I've come across over the past decade.  The program is concise with online classes also available in case anything is missed or needs to be reviewed later. There's no guesswork involved--it's easy to find your strengths and weaknesses (and then improve on them before test date). Also, there's numerous online resources (LSAT interactive, games etc.). I can literally retake the course online.  The office, run by young professionals, has a mellow atmosphere and is well-organized.  Students in other courses seem to be content to be there, so overall welcoming atmosphere... plus free coffee.  Well worth every penny.\",\n",

       " \"Joe Martin was a fantastic instructor. He always encouraged us to ask questions and pushed us to push ourselves. I had to take a couple of my classes with another instructor, because of my schedule, and definitely saw a difference in how deep we went into full comprehension of the material. Take the class with Joe if you can. My GRE math score went up a decent amount after taking this class. I'm giving Manhattan Prep four stars because I thought the course could have been just a tad longer (perhaps 10-12 classes) instead of just the nine or so we had. There were concepts I wish we went over in class that we didn't because of time constraints.\",\n",
       " 'I took the standard 9-session course with Dave Mahler and the experience exceeded my expectations!!  The strategy guides that came with the course provided comprehensive GMAT knowledge points.  The syllables helped me progress in a steady and solid pace.  Dave was patient and thorough in explaining each practice question and key idea in class.  I appreciate how he taught us not only the content, but also the way to approach GMAT learning.  Most of the time, it is not what we learn but how we learn that makes a bigger difference.    I would recommend Manhattan GMAT with Dave to all my friends.  The time and money I invested were definitely worth it.',\n",

They give great overall advice and teach you how to approach the test. The books and online materials are super helpful when you study on your own after the class. I never dreaded going to class and it was enjoyable while you were in it. Overall, I had a great experience and did well on the test only having to take it once due to the great prep from Manhattan Prep',\n",
       " \"When I signed up to take the GMAT I enrolled in a Kaplan online course and went through and did all the class sessions and homework. But by test day, I had only improved about 30-40 points. Needless to say, I did not feel nearly prepared enough to take the GMAT. So I pushed my test date back by 4 months and enrolled in a 9 week in-classroom MGMAT course.  The course was great. My teacher, Gregg, knew how to teach the GMAT in a way that helped us to actually understand the material, rather than just glossing over the fundamentals. The strategy guides were very instructive and really taught me how to do the problems rather than just tips and shortcuts. It was presented in an easy-to-understand manner and I felt like I was making real progress. The class sessions were also very helpful. They helped to cement what I was learning through my homework, and I learned additional strategies and time management techniques. I feel like the Kaplan course was good for the basics, but the MGMAT course really helped to solidify the concepts and take my problem solving abilities to the next level. The online resources were also pretty useful, especially the practice tests. They seem to be fairly representative of the actual test, and my practice test scores were very close to what I actually scored, which ended up being about 110+ points higher than where I was when I started studying.  I would definitely recommend this course for anyone looking to see a huge bump in their score. Even if you can't attend a live class, the full set of books is definitely a score improvement guarantee. I definitely think that MGMAT was a huge factor in me being able to get a 700+ score.\",\n",
       " \"I had a great experience with Manhattan GMAT and have recommended it to dozens of friends. I took the standard 9-week course and felt fully prepared to take the test.  My instructor, Céilidh Erickson, was fantastic, and I have specifically recommended that friends take her course. Céilidh made the 3-hour-long class go quickly with her sense of humor and her enthusiasm for the wiles of the GMAT. Her instruction was clear, confident, and well-paced, and it was obvious that she is truly an expert in this test. She knew everyone's name and got to know each student's strengths and habits. Céilidh was generous with her time, making a point of being available before and after class and via email.  I was also very pleased with the resources Manhattan GMAT provided, especially the online performance-tracking system and the wealth of practice tests and answer explanations.  I will be pursuing my MBA at Tuck (Dartmouth) next year and I have Manhattan GMAT partly to thank.\",\n",
       " 'Manhattan GMAT is the best way to prepare. My score improved tremendously and it was because of the targeted instruction from Jonathan. The material focuses on content, not just tricks of the test. (But you learn tricks too!) I was able to focus on my weaknesses. The classes focuses on teaching you material, but also teaching you how to effectively review the material when you are working on your own time, this helps you make the most of your studying time, both in and out of class. the program is also flexible and allows you to retake classes when you have to miss for any reason, it is a great program and can fit for any working professional or student trying to do well on the GMAT.',\n",
       " \"Studying for the GMAT was one of the hardest/worst things I've ever made myself do (hyperbole much?) but I think it probably would have been harder without Manhattan GMAT.  I took a class and if I had to do it over, I'd probably go with private tutoring.  Compared to the rest of my class, I needed more help on the quant and much less help on the verbal, and because half of each class was devoted to verbal, it sort of felt like wasted time; I wish I'd gone with tutoring (since it's not like the class was that much cheaper) to have had more one-on-one, tailored instruction  That being said, I followed the curriculum religiously and did all the extra worksheets and materials as I prepared.  I took the test 4 months after starting the class and my score went up 80 points from my diagnostic. i think all the materials they give you can be very overwhelming but if you're able to keep up with the syllabus, and really put in the time, you'll see the results.  I appreciate that if you're not happy with your score they let you retake the class basically for the price of the textbooks, and I liked that I was able to have a few one-on-one phone calls with my teacher to go over various practice tests.  I'd definitely recommend MGMAT as a prep company, but I'd suggest you think carefully over whether a class or private tutoring is better for you.\",\n",

       " \"Writing this review was a no-brainer. If you are serious about taking the GMAT, have the time to put in each week to do the work, and want to get a very very good score, Manhattan GMAT is the absolute BEST company to work with.  I took a class in summer 2010. It was a 2-month class and I elected to take the GMAT the week after the class ended. I busted my butt doing the work and scored a 750 on the test.  Manhattan GMAT is the best for several reasons. First, the Manhattan GMAT strategy guides will teach you absolutely everything you need to know for the test--not only how to solve problems, but the tricks and the secrets. You should know these guides backwards and forwards.  Students have access to 6 simulated exams and hundreds of problems on the question banks. I found the verbal problems to be fairly accurate in terms of what you'll find on the GMAT, but the math problems were much harder than anything I saw on the actual GMAT. My point is -- if you are scoring well on the simulated exams then you will score well on the actual GMAT (unless you are really nervous test day, for instance, and just go in blank). Take as many of the simulated exams as possible--one every 2 weeks, for example--to get a sense of where you are.  Also, the instructors are easy to approach and very accessible. You should treat this like school--the instructors work for you and want you to get as high a score as possible. This is obviously how they keep their job! So email them during the week, speak with them after class, do whatever you have to do.  But sign up for Manhattan GMAT. Their curriculum and course structure are the absolute best way to ensure a 700+ score on the GMAT.\",\n",
       " \"I highly, highly recommend Manhattan LSAT. I hadn't planned on taking a class, like the previous reviewer, but sat it on a trail class and was so impressed by the structure and my teacher, Rina, that I signed up right after. Their approach is very thorough and I don't know if it was just the curriculum in general or Rina specifically that managed to keep me interested throughout the entire two months studying and all three hours of my class, but whichever did worked well. You have a ton of materials given to you with the class and the books are so well written and engaging. I can't recommend Manhattan Prep, and especially Rina, enough! Thank you Manhattan prep.\",\n",
       " \"I signed up for the Manhattan Gmat course based on a recommendation from a friend who recently graduated from Columbia Business School. After reading several reviews on various teachers I decided to sign up for Jonathan Schneider's class. Jonathan's class was great! Only downside is that it was a little crowded, but Jonathan did a great job of remembering everyone's names and making sure everyone was on the same page. He explained problems through different methods, so even if you didn't understand the algebraic way of getting to the answer, he would help you understand it through a drawing or making up test numbers, etc. Before taking the class I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I was more than 5 years out of college and hadn't taken a math or writing class in years. My first practice test was atrocious, but I made sure to do the homework every week and asked questions during class. I waited to take the GMAT a month and a half after the class ended for extra study time, and my score increased dramatically--nearly 100 points, hitting right in my target range!\",\n",

She was engaging, led the class well, made sure everyone had a chance to be involved, and maintained a brisk pace of moving through material. She always knew the answer to any question, and knew every word in the book (literally). She sent out weekly emails that used the vocab words we were supposed to be memorizing. The course itself was so useful-- it made vocab memorization manageable and gave extremely useful tips for cutting time for answering questions.  They also give you several online practice tests, which help you become accustomed to taking the test on the computer (honestly, that's half the battle).

I was very disappointed with my tutor because he wasn\\'t prepared for our sessions. I often had to remind him of what we had last covered. At $200 an hour, I expected him to lead the tutoring sessions. I signed up for tutoring because I was afraid that I wouldn\\'t be disciplined enough to complete the online course, but in the end, my perseverance paid off. Actually, most of my friends w/ mba\\'s told me I would probably be successful studying on my own. However, I insisted on getting a tutor because it had been almost a decade since my last math class.  Tutoring isn\\'t for everyone, and if you haven\\'t had one before, I suggest you sign up for one session before committing to a package. I was lucky that they refunded my unused hours but I\\'m not sure that this is a common practice. Student support was very accommodating but it took numerous phone calls for them to respond to my concerns.  In the end, I had over a 100pt gain and \"beat the gmat,\" broke 700. It was due to my perseverance and those great study guides. I studied over a 4 month period and took the test twice. In reality, I had about 2 months of quality studying.

While the teachers are super-smart, educated, and cordial, I find their over-achievement an obstacle to those in class (uhh me), who need to be taught my weak areas from a beginners perspective.  There seems to be an expectancy of fundamentals known...i say, \"if i knew those fundamentals, I wouldn\\'t be here!\".  I\\'d say this is a great class if you need a refresher.  If you are weak in math or verbal, my suggestion would be to teach yourself those basics prior to taking this class.  Their remote-access technology allowing you to access their database from home is very poor, yet their tech-support is helpful and goes out of their way to help out.    On a positive note, it\\'s a young and hip school in a nice Chelsea space.  Cordial staff and management seems to always want to know how to better the school and your learning experience.

Jen Dziura is my teacher, and she is absolutely fabulous.  Her wit and funny examples keep us engaged and eager to learn more.  Every class has the same structure:  first half vocab/reading comp and the second half math.  Each are incredible valuable and truly help you improve your overall GRE score.  Between my first and second practice test, I raised my score 8 points.  Now with further instruction, I\\'m excited to see the next improvement I make.  Throughout the class you broaden your vocabulary and learn tricks to cut corners and improve accuracy.  This class is taught at a fast pace, so it is imperative that you do the outside work, which sometimes can be a bit overwhelming.  However, we receive daily blog emails with vocabulary used in context which helps keep the new material fresh.

There are a lot of different companies offering a variety of online/self-study courses, but I feel that their in-class experience is still the best way to go.  I took this course last year with Dmitry Royter and took the GMAT one month after finishing the course. I took the GMAT twice. I self studied the first time using the MGMAT guides but didn't perform up to my expectations. Then I decided to take the 9-week course, and I scored a 730 on my 2nd shot and will be going to my top choice b-school this fall.  Dmitry was a great instructor and explained all the strategies in a very clear manner. He was always very prepared for class and offered candid advice on what students should prepare for. I also recommend taking the class because it helps you stick to your schedule and introduces many useful tricks that you wouldn't otherwise know about.  The MGMAT material is very solid. I found the practice tests to be slightly harder than the real thing, but it's always better to practice that way. You have access to lots of practice tests and questions, and I suggest you treat them like the real thing as that will really help you improve. MGMAT also provides a free 30 min private tutor every week and this was very helpful to answering specific questions I had in the books.  Getting a high score on the test is all about being able to work efficiently under time pressure and knowing what to study, so I cannot stress enough that you have to practice and practice and also focus on the right materials. I scored a 730 on my second shot and will be going to my top choice business school in the fall.\",\n",

All of the course materials are very helpful and focus on teaching you the material first and then giving you all the tricks and shortcuts.  My instructor, Grace, was awesome!

       " 'I initially discovered Manhattan GMAT my sophomore year as an undergrad at NYU Stern. At that point in time, it was too early to consider sitting for the GMATs, but grad school became a milestone that was approaching the horizon. Come senior year, I knew the time was right to start preparing for the exam, as I was still in \"study mode\" and did not yet work hours that might make attending a weekly review class impossible. My personal goal, along with myriads of other people who take the GMAT, was to get a 700 (and eventually, an acceptance letter to Stanford).  Manhattan GMAT is definitely the best of the prep classes out there, both in terms of the instructors (and their ability to teach test material in an understandable manner) and the tools that are given in order to study (all of the review books, the simulation dry-erase thingie, weekly office hours, simulated exams on the weekends). Personally, I needed a very challenging course because I knew my score would be close to the 90th percentile, just based on my past with standardized tests and academic performance. I used Kaplan and Princeton Review books, and honestly they were like the \"Dummies\" series of GMAT prep. Manhattan GMAT is pricey in comparison, but you do get what you pay for.  My instructor was a quirky guy, with an off-beat sense of humor (so class was interesting). I was slightly disappointed with the personal feedback he gave me at the end of the course; it was vague and not very targeted. I was the only college student amongst my classmates, so I did feel out-of-place. I was the \"know-it-all/smarty pants\" in the class and at times felt like the instructor had to do a lot of backtracking to get some of the other folks up to speed on the fundamentals. My personal philosophy is that people should brush up on the fundamentals on their OWN time, and class time should be more about test-taking strategy and approaching test questions. That was my one gripe, that sometimes we would get hung up on a nuance in sampling with replacement and miss the big picture. There IS homework, so it\\'s important to keep up and not fall behind. It was a huge time commitment on top of my regular coursework. To be honest, I\\'m not sure if I could stay on schedule now that I work.  The office hours I mentioned earlier: for the duration of the course, you can schedule 1-hour phone calls with a Manhattan GMAT tutor. These were very helpful, as were the simulation exams. Basically, you schedule an appointment online and go to the Manhattan GMAT center (usually on the weekend) where you are timed in a computer adaptive setting (it\\'s more realistic than bumming around in your PJs while watching Hangover Saturday or whatever on TBS and MAYBE practicing the Analysis of an Argument). Although the simulation is helpful, it does not compare to the actual test day (I had to take the GMAT twice because I was so psyched out the first time, more on that below).  As a Manhattan GMAT student, I was also offered discounts on the other courses available. I wanted to brush up on data sufficiency, so I took a Quest for 700 course (which is like a Webex/weminar, it only lasts a few hours). I definitely felt like this was helpful and the instructors used the media to the best of their abilities.  So, as I mentioned earlier, I \"bombed\" the GMAT the first time I took it, primarily due to nerves and not fully knowing what to expect (bombed = did not achieve my personal goal). Dude, I was so depressed that I couldn\\'t get out of bed for days and drowned my sorrows in Ben and Jerry\\'s. People thought I broke up with my then-boyfriend, that\\'s how pathetic I was. Anyway, I talked to one of the Manhattan GMAT reps about this (whilst breaking out into hysterics) and she told me that they would extend my online membership (which is where you have access to the practice exams) for another couple of months and that she would set me up with a GMAT counselor/GMAT life coach to help me for next time. Which comes my only qualm with the five star review I am giving: I never received a follow-up regarding the GMAT counselor appointment.  Guess what, I figured it out on my own. After graduation, I spent countless hours on the Eurorail over the next few weeks with my Manhattan GMAT books in tow. I returned from Monte Carlo tan and fabulous and ready to annihilate the GMATs. And I did! I still have my unofficial test score print-out on my fridge (I\\'m a nerd). Thanks Manhattan GMAT!  I\\'ll let you know when the acceptance letter to Stanford arrives.',\n",

They do not offer any gimmicky shortcuts, but rather provide proven strategies for conquering the test that simply work if you are willing to put in the effort.  I took an in-person class, but the online component is also an excellent resource that I found to be very helpful.   My instructor (and everyone else from the company for that matter!) was extremely knowledgeable and professional but also friendly and approachable too.  I would wholeheartedly recommend Manhattan LSAT to anyone who is thinking of taking the LSAT.',\n",
       " 'In my opinion:  Most importantly, Manhattan GMAT has, by far, the best course materials available. During my prep course selection process I could only realistically compare the course curriculum between companies. I spent more than a few visits in Barnes and Noble to look at the Manhattan GMAT, Kaplan, and Princeton Review books.  Anyone who seeks to score well on the GMAT must acknowledge that the majority of the prep work will not be done in the classroom. Therefore, I thought it was crucial that the prep books had good knowledge to impart. As a tutor serving my University I easily recognized the vast amount of effort Manhattan GMAT has put forth in their prep books. I found myself thinking, this is exactly how I would break this problem down for my clients. As I knew that all programs would have highly qualified teachers, the study guide content carried much weight in my decision making process.  Moreover, Manhattan GMAT is unique in that the prep books INTEGRATE the official GMAC study guides. The \"study\" portions of the GMAC books seem like summaries of the Manhattan GMAT guides. At one point in ealy March, I remember looking at the Manhattan guides and telling my friend \"I think MANHATTAN GMAT IS THE REAL DEAL.\"  I finally decided to pursue the test with Manhattan GMAT. At first I was slightly dissappointed with my decision. The classroom interface was not as sleek as some of the other programs. The additional tools, such as the OG Tracker (you will find out soon enough), were also not as sleek as some of the other prep programs appear to be for tracking progress.  Although, after some time, I began to appreciate using the bulkier tools. The reason is two fold: 1. I knew every single data point I entered; watching my right/wrong and timing over/under for every single practice problem 2. The time spent entering information gave my brain brief breaks from problem sets and studying. The result was, that I was mentally fresher and well aquainted with my strengths and weaknesses.  Finally, the staff at Manhattan GMAT have been fantastic. The instructors were prompt in response to any questions outside of class. The customer service team was professional, reasonable, and helpful. Manhattan GMAT and its employees also never made any kind of silly promises. Promises like refunds for unimproved scores. (Please save yourself the time!) The GMAT will teach you the value of wasting even 2 minutes.  If your score doesn\\'t improve during a Manhattan GMAT course, it is not Manhattan\\'s fault. Manhattan GMAT marks the trail, gives you a compass, and a map; but you have to hike for youself to climb the mountain. They can help you climb higher and faster more safely, but the work still rests on the student to achieve the final score.  If you want to be the best you can be, commit yourself to working this program and you will not regret it.  On January 10, 2010 I took a free practice CAT with Manhattan GMAT, my score was a 580.  In early Feburary, I took a brief, non-adaptive, pre-test with Kaplan, my projected score was 630.  In April, May, and June I studied with Manhattan GMAT. In July I reviewed my course objectives and practiced problems daily.  On July 24, 2010 I felt my heart pound as I revealed my score at the Pearson testing center... 760 99th Percentile.  Thank you Manhattan GMAT. Business School, here I come.  -Brent Carpenetti Carpenetti Calculus',\n",
       " 'I completed the Manhattan GMAT December bootcamp back in \\'08. In my opinion choosing Manhattan GMAT materials or classes is the smartest choice a person can make on his or her GMAT preparation.  I originally heard about Manhattan GMAT from a friend, a b-school applicant, who was raving about MGMAT\\'s materials and classes. I did my research by browsing various b-school forums and speaking with friends and found MGMAT to be clearly superior to other \"top\" GMAT preparation services. Here are some key findings from my research and study experience:  1. Manhattan GMAT has instructors of the highest caliber. They are not only as smart as you can find anywhere, but they are also extremely supportive, approachable and excellent at teaching (not to mention great personalities). They will equip you with multiple ways of solving a problem and explain things until you totally \"get it.\"  2. With the exception of the score you get on GMATPrep exams (you can download from mba.com), the score you get on Manhattan GMAT practice exams correlates very strongly to your actual GMAT test. However, you need to keep in mind that Quantitative problems from Manhattan GMAT tend to involve many steps and are therefore more computationally intensively and time-consuming. I\\'ve heard MGMAT is working on addressing this problem but even so these harder problems will train you to be even better at the actual GMAT exam.  3. The study material from Manhattan GMAT is simply the best. The materials from other prep shops such as Kaplan don\\'t even compare (I\\'ve flipped through Kaplan\\'s in Barnes & Noble). All of the Manhattan GMAT study material are excellent but you must paid the most attention to their sentence correction and math guides. I adopted everyone of their techniques in these areas. MGMAT\\'s materials on critical reasoning and reading comprehension are also best in the industry. But in these two areas you need to practice a lot more and use their material as a basis to hone in on your own test taking strategies. For example, their recommendation of drawing a T-diagram was unnecessary (perhaps even damaging) for me personally on doing critical reasoning problems.  Additional pointers: 1. The Official guide problems and GMATPrep questions (try to find every single one of them on the web, not just those that are \"randomly selected\" for you for your practice exam) are THE most important study material first and foremost. OG come with the MGMAT package and GMATPrep you can download.  2. If you\\'re working, I think 9-week course is perfect as it provides you with the discipline. Studying for the GMAT is no joke, you\\'ll need discipline and stamina.  3. If you\\'re short of time, take the bootcamp. But I would caution you to allow for at least 2 possible test dates (you can take an exam every 30 days) AFTER you finish the bootcamp and BEFORE the application submission deadline. Even the best of us can mess up on the first try.  4. If you\\'re really disciplined, I think doing the self-study program from MGMAT would be best.  5. In my opinion, Manhattan GMAT will get you 80% there (no other prep shop would even come close), and the rest must come from doing actual old GMAT problems like crazy to discover and really get the feel for the patterns in the answers.  Manhattan GMAT might not make you smarter. But if your goal is in beating the GMAT (700+) and you\\'re not not afraid of hard work, you have the best chance when you choose Manhattan GMAT.  I know this review sounds like an advertisement but I\\'m taking the time to write it because I want to benefit others and  because I feel very grateful for their services (I got a 700+)',\n",
       " \"This is a great service. I went from a 590 on the practice GMAT to a 720 on the real gmat after a couple months of studying. (730+ on final practices)  My instructors were really smart and and are really good at explaining more complicated material.  The customer service was great as well. I've never had a problem with questions and they were always cheerful when replying to questions.  The location of Manhattan Gmat right in midtown Manhattan & ambiance were also great. It's a modern setup which was aesthetically pleasing.  The class makeup policies were also second to none. I've missed 3-4 classes and had no problems at all rescheduling.  I highly recommend taking these classes if your goal is a high gmat score.\",\n",
       " \"Overall I had a very good experience with Manhattan GMAT.  The administrative team is helpful and knowledgeable and I was very pleased with the instructor who made the 3-hour class after a long day of work rather painless.    I started my course in September.  When I began, I had no major plans to take the exam quickly or by a certain date.  I took what the instructor said to heart about not waiting too long to take the GMAT and set the date for about 2 months after the class finished.  I just took my exam last week and am very pleased with my score.  Five months ago I was just starting to think about it and now I am finished - I couldn't be more relieved.    The course is expensive but it gave me a) ALL the materials I needed to study, b) the foundation I needed to really start the studying process, and c) the motivation I so desperately needed to do work outside of class.  I was very diligent with my homework so I had a strong foundation on which to build when I started working on official GMAT questions.    Not only did I get a great deal out of the classes themselves and the homework assignments, but there was always support if I had any questions on the answer explanations (indispensable) on the practice exams or questions about signing up to take the GMATeven after my class was finished.  It is obvious that the people at Manhattan GMAT care about their students and really want them to do well.  I recommend the school to anyone who is serious about doing well on the GMAT.\",\n",
       " \"Manhattan GMAT is the best if you're serious about the test.  I got advice from several friends who had used a number of different test prep programs, and they recommended this one.  Manhattan GMAT is expensive, but it's worth it.  They supply you with all the tools, materials, teaching, and advice that you need to crush the test, but you have to be willing to put in the time and effort.\",\n",
       " 'I had a great experience with Manhattan LSAT. Everyone is extremely professional and friendly and puts you at ease right away. I went the route of one-on-one tutoring and was really impressed with the caliber of the teaching. I was able to raise my score to the range I was shooting for. I definitely think they can help anyone reach their full potential.',\n",
       " 'I was borderline between giving Manhattan GMAT 3 and 4 stars, but in the end I did as well as I had hoped to do and I am appreciative for that.  I think that the program is great, VERY great organizer that tells you literally every problem you should be doing. The class I took had a bad teacher and so that experience was a complete waste for me. I would recommend sitting in on classes with a few different teachers before picking the one you want.  One of the most valuable parts for me was access to a free tutor for 30 minutes a week throughout the course of your studying. I had one tutor who I originally thought was great, but did not point out to me my shortcomings and as a result of my inconsistency, my first GMAT score was not very good. I then, by chance got Liz for a tutor and she was AMAZING. She single handedly explained to me what I was doing that was keeping my scores inconsistent and what I needed to do. As a result I increased my GMAT score by 50 points.  Thank you LIZ!!!!',\n",
       " 'I would definitely recommend the Manhattan GMAT Prep program.  I signed up for the traditional nine-week course in September.  Approximately two months after completing the course I took the GMAT and beat my target score (700).  The course provides a recommended schedule, which is a bit intense, but worth the effort.  The books/materials are well written and straightforward.  Additionally, the course is flexible in that it allows students to take makeup classes online or at the center.  All of the instructors I met seemed well informed and friendly.  The program is a bit more expensive than others, but worth the cost.',\n",
       " \"I enrolled in Manhattan GMAT's program in New York City last year, and found it lived up to my expectations completely.  The best  thing about the program is the teachers, especially my teacher Andrew.  You know the teachers are smart and really know the material, no doubt a result of them having to score in the 99th percentile.  Andrew and the entire staff at MGMAT were very helpful and you could tell they were genuinely interested in helping you get the score you were trying to achieve.  I had taken the GMAT a year earlier and managed a 590 and was able to score a 730 after my MGMAT class. They not only teach you the necessary content, but also the strategies to conquer the GMAT. If you want a 700+ score this is the way to go.\",\n",
       " \"I did a lot of research before signing up for Manhattan GMAT.  Kaplan has offices right near my apartment so it was really tempting to pick them and lesson my commute when class ends at 9:30 pm, but the overall feedback I heard was that Kaplan is the fast food of test services.  They don't specialize in the GMAT like MGMAT does.  There instructors are young (i have a few friends who teach Kaplan) and yes they are smart, but not as professional as the quality of teachers MGMAT attracts.  The books for MGMAT are far superior to the others, i've gotten books from friends who've taken kaplan and princeton, and Manhattan GMAT is much more thorough.  The thing about Manhattan GMAT is that they focus on concepts not as much on tricks.  If you're someone who can't understand math at all, and works better with pure strategy, MGMAT might not be for you.  Instead of telling you want modifiers, and subjective form are about, they more expect you to know coming in.  I suggest if you've been out of school for more than 2 years you brush up on the foundations of math before you start your course.  My instructor was perky and smart, and you can tell they are the best around........they get paid more per hour than other instructors.  The location on 25th and 6th isn't the best or the most convenient but it is what it is.  The computer adaptive tests that they make available on their website is the most helpful.  When you start really look over everythign the website offers you, the forums are great, they have staff pretty much 24/7 to respond to your needs.  I'm also pretty sure if you search online for coupons you can get 15% off the price, which is helpful since it is more expensive than the others.\",\n",
       " \"I took the Manhattan GMAT course in New Haven after discovering that I really didn't have the materials or self-motivation to study properly for the GMAT. I didn't need any classes or tutoring for the SAT but the GMAT is a different beast. The class is useful as long as you keep up with the material and commit to doing the homework and making full use of the resources available to you, so if you have the discipline to do the self-study guides I would recommend that because the bulk of the learning comes from the strategy guides and really understanding the basics behind the questions before you do serious practice. The courses are generally really well taught though and the instructors really know their stuff, so if you do better with some structure go for the course. It is definitely a curriculum geared towards people who want higher scores (i.e. 700 range), so don't expect a lot of time to be spent on the basics. I found this a relief though because I was starting out in the high 600-s and wanted to hit the 99th percentile, which I did after one try. The MGMAT course definitely gives you the opportunity to make that much of an improvement if you're committed to it.\",\n",

They helped me boost my score by 10 points putting me deep into the 97th percentile.',\n",

For people like me, it helped me prioritize certain topics and hone in on where my shortcomings were. In addition, Jerry likes to check in with his students to see how they're doing without being too invasive. This helps apply just enough pressure to keep you on task with your study plan.<p>\n",

Their materials are incredibly user-friendly and are helpful throughout the process (i.e., from when you need to be explained things as if you're in kindergarten to when you are tackling more advanced topics/problems). Also, the class is a must - it provided a solid framework/syllabus for approaching the vast topic areas and Matthew provided incredible tips/tricks for approaching the test.

Manhattan Prep doesn't hold any in-person classes near me, so I had to take the online course. I was a little nervous about it at first because I thought I would get distracted if I wasn't in a classroom. However, I think the online course was a great decision for me. The Manhattan Prep instructors are extremely helpful and make time during class to give you one-on-one attention. There were ~10 people in my class and 2 instructors. The class met for 3 hours every week. The instructors engaged everyone in the classroom by calling on students and making an effort to understand everyone's thought process. The instructors solved practice problems with us, thoroughly explained common mistakes or misunderstandings, and walked through ways to approach problems that I found extremely useful on the test. I felt comfortable asking questions in class and reaching out to the instructors outside of class as well. Manhattan Prep also offers several practice exams with full, worked-out solutions and performance analytics capabilities. In addition to the 9-week online class, the plethora of resources available to me during through Manhattan Prep (GMAT Official Guide, Manhattan Prep books, practice exams, etc.) were invaluable to my success on the exam! I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to maximize their score on the GMAT!<p>\n",

       " <p itemprop=\"description\">I took the Manhattan Prep Live Online Course because I had read great reviews of the company and also saw that they offered a 25% student discount (I am currently a college student, so this was very appealing to me). Manhattan Prep doesn't hold any in-person classes near me, so I had to take the online course. I was a little nervous about it at first because I thought I would get distracted if I wasn't in a classroom. However, I think the online course was a great decision for me. The Manhattan Prep instructors are extremely helpful and make time during class to give you one-on-one attention. There were ~10 people in my class and 2 instructors. The class met for 3 hours every week. The instructors engaged everyone in the classroom by calling on students and making an effort to understand everyone's thought process. The instructors solved practice problems with us, thoroughly explained common mistakes or misunderstandings, and walked through ways to approach problems that I found extremely useful on the test. I felt comfortable asking questions in class and reaching out to the instructors outside of class as well. Manhattan Prep also offers several practice exams with full, worked-out solutions and performance analytics capabilities. In addition to the 9-week online class, the plethora of resources available to me during through Manhattan Prep (GMAT Official Guide, Manhattan Prep books, practice exams, etc.) were invaluable to my success on the exam! I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to maximize their score on the GMAT!<p>\n",
